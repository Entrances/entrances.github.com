We are travelling somewhere together. Like a foldable machine. Revolving around our own axis. Rolling down the side of the ephemeral pyramid. Dennis Hopper once said to travel is the only true joy. But he was probably incorrect. In fact he never even said that, it is a fictional statement. During this trip we will learn to understand the difference between reality and fiction - if there is any. The wheels are in motion. If we could just pull the lever jump to the other side of the platform - like in one of those platform action computer games from the 90's. Sharks have gills. That's what I'm thinking as I sit in the car looking out the car window as we are travelling together.
