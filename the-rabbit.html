Hello Mr. Rabbit. Why are you sitting in a hole? Well, it's so much fun here, that's why. Oh, that's interesting. I see. Yah. I built the hole with a spade just yesterday. Oh, really, I say. That's interesting.  

I sold a spade at the tool shop, I say. Oh, really, the rabbit says. Yah, I say. Did you eat any carrots today, Mr. Rabbit, I ask? Yes, as a matter of fact I did, the rabbit replies. 

I bought a hammer in the tool shop. Now I can build just about anything. Oh, says the rabbit. It was forged in the magical blacksmith shop beyond Thunderdome, I say. Oh, really, says the rabbit.

I need a couple of nails or something now I suppose, that's the problem. When you have a hammer you get sorta dependent on nails. 

I guess I could build a house using this hammer, I say. I guess you could, the rabbit says.
