<title><![CDATA[Opinions on an article arguing it is easier to conduct a 51% attack on PoS than PoW]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/23308/opinions-on-an-article-arguing-it-is-easier-to-conduct-a-51-attack-on-pos-than]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>For those who are not familiar, one of the main selling points of proof-of-stake is that it makes it more difficult to conduct a 51% attack. The reasoning is that to conduct a 51% attack on a proof-of-work coin, you just need to get enough hashpower. But to conduct a 51% on a PoS coin, you need to own 51% of the coins, meaning that you'd be heavily invested in the coin, so you would be disincentivized from performing an action that could jeopardize the value of your coins. Even if somebody (e.g. the government) simply wanted to kill the coin without regard to financial incentives, it would still be much more expensive to buy 51% of the coins than to buy enough miners to get you up to 51% hashrate, especially given that you would be eating up the orderbook and paying much more than market price.</p>

<p>I recently read an intriguing article titled <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2393940" rel="nofollow">It Will Cost You Nothing to 'Kill' a Proof-of-Stake Crypto-Currency</a>. In the article, the author argues the opposite: a 51% attack on PoS is actually very cheap when done by a credible entity such as the government. The attacker could announce their intention to kill the coin and offer to buy up everyone's coin for a price far below market price. Since the attacker is credible, holders of the coin will know that if they hold on to their coins, the attacker will acquire 51% of the coins and, using this 51% stake, prevent any transactions from being confirmed, killing the coin. (If your coins can't be sent, then you can't spend or sell them, so they're worthless.) Therefore, people will be willing to sell their coins to the attacker at that price, to at least get some value for their coins before they become worthless.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Bitcoin could be worth 1000x today's value within two years, or it could be worth nothing given the community's trajectory lately. Here are my two millibits on our possible future(s).]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/20044n/bitcoin_could_be_worth_1000x_todays_value_within/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>It's not the community's fault, by the way.</p> <p>Bitcoin is getting attacked in complex, sophisticated ways we will only understand fully much later. Glenn Greenwald's <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">latest scoop</a>, which went largely 'unnoticed' by the corporate media, was that GCHQ/NSA use trolls to harass, intimidate, derail online communities, and destroy the lives of 'hacktivists' (i.e. tech savvy activists) the surveillance agency dislikes. </p> <p>Based on my preliminary research, the Bitcoin community is falling victim to nearly identical tactics.</p> <p>There is no need for us to point fingers at each other or give in to paranoia - in fact, that's one of the intended outcomes of online <em>provocateurs</em> in the first place. </p> <p>We are all aware, however, that some individuals have tried their best to make Bitcoin look very bad in the eyes of the public, and some members of the media have tried their damnedest to keep their viewers from ever wanting to explore the "seedy," "dangerous," "unregulated," world of the scary "bitcorn".</p> <p>My background dictates that I look very closely not only at forensics, but at motives. I see tremendous motive from vested interests around the world - governments, banks, some payment processors, investing opportunists - to attack Bitcoin now, with everything they've got.</p> <p>Again, no need to finger point, because <strong>Bitcoin is a battle you folks win.</strong></p> <p>In fact, you've already won, on paper at least. Bitcoin is a much better <em>technology</em> than the credit card in your wallet or your checking account. That is fact. Your credit card is basically a private key exposed, half-assed department store financial product designed 60 years ago (actually, that's exactly what a credit card is). And your Too Big To Fail checking account is a Mt. Gox account with a better PR department. </p> <p>They can spread a lot of fear - and they are doing so - but a time will come when consumers take a sober look at cryptocurrency face to face with its "competition". And the choice is clear. This is a Pepsi Challenge you all win any day of the week, without fail.</p> <p><strong>Crypto is better, the only way it can be destroyed is to prevent it from gaining critical mass.</strong></p> <p>You have to understand - that's the motive here. </p> <p>How do you beat a technology that's clearly better, faster, cheaper than yours, in every single way? <strong>You destroy its reputation. You peddle fear. You make something that was initially tempting scary and unwelcome.</strong></p> <p>If Bitcoin loses in the court of public opinion, which it is rapidly doing, Bitcoin loses. Forever.</p> <p>You can be the best accountant in the world. If your neighbors spread the rumor that you might be killing kittens in your backyard, no one will want to hire you. <strong>A reputational loss, therefore, CAN destroy an otherwise superior product or service.</strong></p> <p>Cryptocurrency can survive another Mark Karpeles, or ten more if need be, but it can't survive a public that no longer has any use for it. </p> <p>The solution is first of all, to be more savvy as a community. Don't upvote every blogger's traffic hungry bullshit. Don't peddle unfounded fear yourself. Verify your information. Don't use exchange services with no track record, when there are now services operating with a decent track record, full compliance, and credible financial backers. </p> <p><strong>And second of all, the solution is to use Bitcoin constantly.</strong> </p> <p>CONSTANTLY!</p> <p>That's how you will see a 100x or 1000x gain over time, if making money is your thing. </p> <p>As transaction volume scales, demand must in turn scale. And the various scarcity elements of Bitcoin will kick into overdrive once this becomes a household means of paying friends, buying products online, tipping musicians you like on Soundcloud, etc. </p> <p>Some finance and lawyer types have snuck into the Bitcoin world, and they sound like they are completely full of shit. They don't "get" Bitcoin or the tremendous changes that decentralized personal finance will bring. They just see Bitcoin as a new ETF type thing for them to make a quick 30% from and maybe some fat consulting fees or book deal. Nothing <em>too</em> wrong with that, I guess, but certainly not who you want to prop up as spokespeople for the community. They want to talk regulation all day and beg for establishment adoption. That's, again, how you get a 30% gain. Not how you get a 1,000% or 10,000% gain.</p> <p>The only spokesperson type I trust here is Andreas Antonopoulos, everything he says is pretty much a more intelligent version of what I would want to say in a similar situation. And I think even Andreas would agree the instant he starts talking shit or harming Bitcoin, you should abandon him, or anyone else who becomes a liability to the community's long-term aims. </p> <p>Huge gains will only come from true widespread adoption, not from convincing a bunch of thoroughly boring assholes to dip their hedge fund toes into the crypto pond. </p> <p>The Bitcoin community is accused of "fanaticism" by the mainstream press from time to time. </p> <p>If your product is better, if your worldview is more sane and more efficient for all stakeholders, <strong>it's OK to be fanatical.</strong></p> <p>In fact, you'd better be, or those with an inferior product and superior marketing muscle will talk you right out of business.</p> <p>That's exactly what is happening now, with all the bullshit people in this subreddit who don't own any coin, but constantly complain, constantly accuse the rest of us of "circle jerking".</p> <p>Some of these people are idiots. Some of them are angry they missed the boat on Bitcoin's first couple big jumps. And I believe some of them are more coordinated, professional forms of manipulation. In the case of the professional manipulation, the aim isn't to troll you or me. It's to create a "negative image" around the community itself - that we're complainers, not a fun place to browse, not a fun product to use. Check their comment histories: either brand new accounts, or accounts that exclusively spread anti-Bitcoin content. You have to ask yourself what's going on.</p> <p>The solution here is probably to have more active mods. Don't be ashamed to delete and ban manipulators. Freedom of speech is sacrosanct, but it doesn't extend to a forum where users of a cryptocurrency are trying to help each other improve that currency and enhance its reach. Block them without regret - there's a difference between honest questioning or criticism of Bitcoin's "power structure" and overt, repeated manipulation.</p> <p>Anyway, I have to leave it here as I am already late for work. Hope someone enjoyed reading this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/CryptoDonDraper"> CryptoDonDraper </a> <br><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/20044n/bitcoin_could_be_worth_1000x_todays_value_within/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/20044n/bitcoin_could_be_worth_1000x_todays_value_within/">[103 comments]</a>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I built the following rig:</p>

<p>5x SAPPHIRE TRI-X R9 280X 3GB GDDR5 OC (UEFI)
1x AeroCool Templarius Imperator 1150W 80 Plus Gold
1x HighPower Tech 1200w Gold Plus (HP-1200-G14C-GOLD)
1x Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 motherboard
1x W.D Caviar Green 500GB SATA III HDD
1x Kingston KHX1600C9D3B1/4G
2x Unpowered risers 1x 16x
3x Powered risers 1x 16x</p>

<p>I have the templarius PSU powering the motherboard, the HDD and 2x GPUs with unpowered risers.
The other 3 gpus are powered by the 1200w PSU and connected to the powered usb risers.</p>

<p>I Installed Windows 8.1 and plugged one gpu. It automatically installed the Radeon HD 7990 driver. Then connected the second gpu and followed the same process with the other gpus.</p>

<p>I then executed cgminer and everything looks stable at 740Khs each.</p>

<p>However 1h later the rig shuts down. It always shuts down aprox. 1h later..</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I read in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3656" rel="nofollow">this Github pull</a> that Bitcoin relies on weaker cryptographic guarantees than SHA256.</p>

<p>What are the weaker cryptographic guarantees being referred to?</p>

<p>Could it be that RipeMD is 160 bits? ... or is it something else? Perhaps in the ECC curve itself?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>"Dear Idiots, </p> <p>I'm not going to bury the lead; I am not publishing the article tomorrow that I said I was going to on Friday. </p> <p>In fact, I never intended to (not yet anyway), and I certainly never intended to loop in the main-stream media so that they could pile on to our fledgling community. I simply hoped that a deadline would pressure Jon and Peter to resign quickly (and appropriately).</p> <p>While my accusations on Friday were 100% truthful, I now see that I have overplayed my hand. Rather than go all-in with a losing hand, I'm mucking my cards. I never anticipated this degree of backlash from within the community. As such, any further efforts to publicly push for resignations are not well-focused, and I plan to turn down the rhetoric. </p> <p>On the other hand, I'll reiterate that while my hyperbolic tone was poor and regrettable, I continue to believe that the Bitcoin Foundation in its current incarnation is significantly damaged, and that Peter Vessenes and Jon Matonis should resign. But it may be better to let the Foundation die a slow, quiet death than to organize a public execution. </p> <p>I consider myself a Bitcoin entrepreneur first and foremost, and I think that a public spectacle would just provide ammunition for Bitcoin's formidable external foes. Better to let the community purge itself. </p> <p>There are many reasons I took the course of action that I did, but as my unorthodox strategy ultimately proved unproductive, I'll bow out of the conversation with respect to the Bitcoin Foundation without explanations or defensiveness. </p> <p>I'm sure I'll be eating humble pie and ramen while I try to rebuild some of my damaged relationships. </p> <p>I tried something risky. It blew up in my face. That's ok; I'll take my medicine.</p> <p>Looking forward to getting back to my regular boring Daily Bits tomorrow.</p> <p>Cheers, TBI</p> <p>P.S. If you are looking for a great event where you can drink from the firehose of Bitcoin knowledge, meet the movers and shakers from within the industry and have a great time in the process, you should register for the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York City on April 7-8. The full conference experience is priceless.

<title><![CDATA[Share is above target when switching between stratums]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/23296/share-is-above-target-when-switching-between-stratums]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm running a pool for some friends and myself, where we mine both dogecoin and litecoin (and occasionaly some other flavor of the day).
The farms are pointing to a simple proxy: a C daemon that is connected to the stratums for easy socket switching.</p>

<p>When switching from one coin to the other, the stratum server immediately throws "Share is above target" errors.
When it switches back to the original coin, all shares are accepted again</p>

<p>Exactly what causes the 'share is above target' error?
Based on the logs below, is there a problem with the mining software or with the stratum sending the wrong data?</p>

<p>Both stratums are configured with a fixed diff level, vardiff is disabled.
Here's a log of data going back and forth between a mining farm and server</p>

<p><strong>step 1/5: litecoin stratum sends work to mining farm</strong></p>

<pre><code>{"params": ["ed84", "716a78103f53858c8baadc8179bdbc3012c981db2a41b552998cdc06b6bae287", "01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff27034f0f08062f503253482f04398b1c5308", "0d2f7374726174756d506f6f6c2f0000000001a078072a010000001976a914238e80769414592ed96192e13cddf78953e84ff388ac00000000", ["a346c6f74e37f6528e9d34e35c530a79bf11487d5c9404574972ac652331943f", "117086b6331ecef97572a981b1d2a7baf269b163a0c252c03a9f8b93cf1fdc03", "fef9b6758f809b998ce072d7bddefa86657dbee2d0fe1d71fd8a6a5558fa4dce", "7caa16ac719103ea85494bf15ec0b27507fb7367b36c01ccea2151f2eebdc811", "bdf9a2879e8cee859d2510fa63c57411f5b2e32fe0e237f597d28e6add7a9923"], "00000002", "1b0dd506", "531c8b3c", true], "id": null, "method": "mining.notify"}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>step 2/5: mining farm sends 6 valid shares to litecoin stratum</strong></p>

<p><strong>step 3/5: system redirects mining farm to dogecoin stratum at this point</strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mIOdcu1.jpg"><img src="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mIOdcu1-300x223.jpg" alt="Example of Dorian Nakamoto meme." width="300" height="223"></a><p>Example of Dorian Nakamoto meme.</p></div>Within moments of <em>Newsweek</em> <a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/ap-newsweek-subject-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin-creator/">claiming to have identified mysterious, possibly pseudononymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto</a> as retired Temple City, California, engineer Dorian S. Nakamoto, many in the Bitcoin community immediately began crying foul. A modest man living a quiet existence with his 93-year-old mother suddenly had his life turned into a media circus, all on the circumstantial evidence of a magazine profile.
<p>Further complicating the situation is the rapidly growing case that <em>Newsweek</em> got it wrong, and that <a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/isnt-great-dorian-satoshi-nakamoto-mystery/">Dorian Nakamoto had nothing to do with Bitcoin&rsquo;s development</a>, and simply shares a name with its creator. His life has been upturned and exposed, not to mentioned his <a href="http://imgur.com/mIOdcu1" target="_blank">face turned into a meme</a>, simply because of a reporter&rsquo;s bad hunch.</p>
<p>In response to this, Bitcoin developer <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ztjmg/andreas_im_fundraising_for_dorian_nakamoto/" target="_blank">Andreas Antonopoulos posted an appeal on Reddit</a> to raise money for Dorian Nakamoto. </p>
<blockquote><p>I have no idea if this person is Satoshi, though it seems increasingly unlikely. However, it doesn&rsquo;t matter either way. If this person is Satoshi, then the funds are a small &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; and won&rsquo;t make much of a difference.</p>
<p>However, if this person is not Satoshi, then these funds will serve as a &ldquo;sorry for what happened to you&rdquo;, help with medical bills his family is facing, any legal bills they may incur, or anything else. Most of all, it serves to soften the damage caused by irresponsible journalism and to demonstrate the generosity and empathy of the community, which I know is huge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Response to this appeal was immediate and significant. As of this writing, over 43 BTC have been sent to the donation address (1Dorian4RoXcnBv9hnQ4Y2C1an6NJ4UrjX), amounting to roughly $28,000.</p>
<p>The fund will accept donations until the end of March, at which point it will be converted into USD and donated to Dorian Nakamoto. If Nakamoto rejects the donation, it will be donated to the charity of his choice. If he refuses to communicate at all, it will be donate to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="http://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/abblog/blog.pl?/pl/2014/3/1394372710.html" target="_blank">finance writer Brian Cohen</a> uncovered details about eBay&rsquo;s wallet, outlining the details of a 2011 patent application for a <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20130173416" target="_blank">&ldquo;System And Method For Managing Transactions In A Digital Marketplace.&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>The patent application specifically mentions Bitcoin, as well as other possibilities such as credit card reward points and travelers checks, as currencies the wallet would be able to exchange. As explained in the patent application:</p>
<blockquote><p>The currency module is configured to manage exchange of digital currency. Accordingly, the currency module allows a user to trade one form of currency for another form of currency. In one embodiment, one of the forms of currency being traded is cash. The digital currency may be used to pay for real-world financial obligations (e.g., bills) as well as for virtual-world obligations&hellip;&rdquo; </p></blockquote>
<p>Cohen notes that the eBay wallet, which has yet to be granted a patent, would solve significant issues in the current virtual currency ecosystem on the mainstream consumer level.</p>
<blockquote><p>PayPal has the ability to become a trusted Bitcoin wallet and people would be willing to pay good Bitcoin (err, money) for such a service. Basically just like you wouldn&rsquo;t keep your entire life savings in your everyday wallet, users of Bitcoin shouldn&rsquo;t keep their entire bitcoin savings online. An elegant trusted cold storage (i.e. offline) solution is needed and I hope that PayPal is chiseling away at this problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>While Cohen does believe that virtual currencies are the future of finance, he wasn&rsquo;t yet sold on Bitcoin as the clear winner. He noted that anyone can create a currency using the fundamental concepts of cryptocurrency, and that simply because Bitcoin was the first doesn&rsquo;t mean it will be the dominant virtual currency in coming years.</p>
<p>He also noted that some issues, such as truly safe storage of funds, have yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>As the one-time technology advisor to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Cohen clearly has his eye on the big picture of politically viable financial policy as much as technical wizardry. Cohen&rsquo;s comments came up as part of his on-stage conversation with Google&rsquo;s Chairman Eric Schmidt. The pair were at the festival to promote their new book, <em>The New Digital Age</em>.</p>

<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/23253/how-can-auroracoin-be-the-4th-crypto-coin-by-market-cap-if-its-unreleased-yet]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://auroracoin.org/" rel="nofollow">Auroracoin</a> has become <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="nofollow">the 4th biggest crypto-currency</a> measured in market capitalization. How can an as-yet unreleased coin have market value if it's not available for exchange (either for fiat or for another crypto-coin) anywhere??? In fact, save for the storage accounts of its creator, <em>noone</em> has an Auroracoin yet. So whence comes its valuation and thus its market cap???</p>

<p>As much as I admire the stated intentions of Auroracoin's creators and their ingenuity for turning stuff traditionally seen as BAD (premining, universal and compulsory registration for all citizens) into GOOD, this market cap point makes me a bit suspicious.</p>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/10947/bitcoin-regulation-update-030714/"><img width="400" height="266" src="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ravenbit-physical-bitcoin-closeup-1015a-400.jpg" alt="ravenbit-physical-bitcoin-closeup-1015a-400"></a><p dir="ltr">This week saw the outing (or not) of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin&rsquo;s alleged inventor, who is said to have abruptly disappeared from the online forums he was known to frequent in Bitcoin&rsquo;s early days. Though the man alleged to be Nakamoto, who was living under a different name in the United States, denied involvement with Bitcoin, Newsweek, the publication that broke the story, stands behind their work. The early response from the online Bitcoin community could best be described as a low grade form of moral outrage, combined with a dash of horror. What seems to have upset Bitcoiners most is the fact that a media outlet was able to identify and publicly name a person who clearly was not interested in being identified, using little more than public information and basic detective work. To the extent that the majority of crypto enthusiasts value privacy, if not anonymity, the Satoshi Nakamoto affair does not bode well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Canada-based Bitcoin exchange Vault of Satoshi announced via Facebook on Thursday that it would <a href="http://newsbtc.com/2014/03/06/vault-satoshi-ceasing-u-s-operations-due-incre%20asingly-hostile-regulatory-environment/">discontinue</a> support for US customers due to an &ldquo;increasingly hostile&rdquo; regulatory environment. The exchange, which connects users with others looking to trade crypto currencies for fiat currencies, claimed to be facing considerable difficulties complying with FinCEN&rsquo;s anti-money laundering rules, not the least of which was FinCEN&rsquo;s policy disallowing the filing of paper reports by money service businesses and the seeming incompatibility of the online reporting system with foreign businesses. The decision to abandon the US market entirely seems to be a fairly drastic response to US law, which could rightly be described as overly complicated. Vault of Satoshi is neither the first nor the only non-US based company to face US regulatory requirements, so it isn&rsquo;t clear why it seems to be having unusual difficulty in this area. &nbsp;The company&rsquo;s Bitcoin to US dollar volume on Friday stood at 280 coins as of 5:00 PM CST, compared to 314 for Bitcoin to Canadian dollars. Under the new policy, US traders will be unable to deposit or withdraw cash from the exchange, but will be permitted to trade coins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet another exchange, this time Canadian company Flexcoin, informed customers this week that it is <a href="http://www.euronews.com/2014/03/05/another-bitcoin-bank-bites-the-dust-flexc%20oin-blames-losses-on-hackers/">insolvent</a> as the result of a hack induced theft and would have no choice but to cease operations. The exchange lost an estimated $500,000 worth of coins in its hot wallet, but a spokesman said that customer coins in cold storage would be returned to their owners. &nbsp;Flexcoin referred to its terms of service, reminding its customers that they agreed not to hold Flexcoin liable for theft, while informing everyone else that they were out of luck. The operative verbiage states that &ldquo;Flexcoin is not responsible for insuring any bitcoins stored in the Flexcoin system.&rdquo; Whether this will be sufficient to ward off civil liability remains to be seen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs service in the United Kingdom has reportedly <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2104080/uk-tax-authority-clarifies-policy-on-%20bitcoin.html">dropped</a> a plan to apply value added taxes to mined bitcoins and Bitcoin exchange transactions. However, the treasury maintained in a brief delivered to British lawmakers that the 20% VAT still applies to goods and services purchased with bitcoins, just the same as it would if those same goods and services were purchased with Pounds. After a careful review, HM Treasury was more likely to have discovered the near impossibility of taxing Bitcoin at the point of exchange or the point of creation, than to have determined that it falls outside the scope of transactions subject to the tax. &nbsp;Merchants, on the other hand, are already accustomed to collecting VAT and equipped with the infrastructure both to report it and to comply with the audit requirements of the British government. The UK has developed a reputation in the Bitcoin community of late for being comparatively friendly to crypto currency from a regulatory standpoint and more accessible than US regulators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vietnam&rsquo;s Communist government has officially<a href="http://www.pfhub.com/vietnam-officially-bans-all-bitcoin-transactions-424/"> banned</a> all Bitcoin transactions. The Vietnamese central bank announced the policy, citing Bitcoin&rsquo;s alleged role in promoting money laundering and other criminal activity. The bank did not specify how the ban would be enforced or what the penalties for non-compliance would be. The Vietnamese government maintains restrictive capital controls (ostensibly to protect the Dong against speculators), that Bitcoin could be used to subvert. Few exchanges offer the ability to convert from Bitcoin to the Vietnamese Dong. &nbsp;However, other currencies, such as the US dollar, are in common use on Vietnam&rsquo;s streets, especially in urban centers.</p>
<p>Japan has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/07/japan-government-has-no-plans-to-regulate-bitcoin-transactions-after-mt-goxs-demise/">announced</a> that it will not attempt to regulate Bitcoin transactions carried out within its borders on the grounds that bitcoins are not considered a currency. However, Japanese banks will be prohibited from buying or selling bitcoins. The Japanese government also clarified that it intends to treat Bitcoin as a commodity and subject it to the applicable taxation regime. Japan is the home of Mt. Gox, the collapsed Bitcoin exchange which is currently the subject of a bankruptcy filing in that country, along with at least one criminal probe and numerous civil suits.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Arthur Nakamoto: My brother, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto...]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zx9zj/arthur_nakamoto_my_brother_dorian_satoshi_nakamoto/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Mis-quoting and blatant lies are unfortunately the journalistic world that exists today. I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that.</p> <p>I and my immediate family were frightened due to obvious safety concerns, angered by our privacy being invaded and highly concerned over a gentle man trying, trying to recover from his life threatening health concerns. He was so private that he did not tell me when he was going through his health threats, only told me quietly when I visited the house in Temple City to take our mother for lunch. And I am his blood brother.</p> <p>I recall as a child that I looked up to Dorian, who I believe is many times smarter than I am. He taught me as a toddler, protected me from harm, shared with me Manga, the Japanese comic books and made up fantastic stories til I fell asleep. I am forever indebted to him in saving my life when I was 9 years old. He probably doesn&rsquo;t remember anymore, but I do and that&rsquo;s what matters to me. I called the writer an asshole and told her to leave my brother alone but the whole world did not read that, why? Dorian can be stubborn and be an asshole but then I am telling the whole world right here and now that I and only 2 other people in the whole world can say that to him and we are automatically forgiven by him in an instant. He can call me an asshole too and has and maybe a few &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; or &ldquo;morons&rdquo;, but you know, he was probably right and can prove it. That&rsquo;s private. </p> <p>How dare this Leah demean, belittle the comforts of an old man in poor health who has barely enough money to feed himself and takes gentle care of our 93 year old mother in a modest house. To act and publish with carefully studied thought along with professional profilers, editors who calculated greed to ultimately endanger my brother's health and his physical safety. To be callous enough to place the safety of our 93 year old mother as a person of no consequence? Their collective act that published their magazines and follow-up public reports speak volumes of the motivation tied to greed. Who is going to be responsible in their safety, her, the executives at Newsweek, the entire Journalistic community? Yes, I place Leah McGraw Goodman and Newsweek and all news organizations that had joined in the feeding frenzy to be held responsible for their blatant and open carelessness.</p> <p>I understand that I will be mis-quoted in this post and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. I can and will have no choice that to be slandered and live with that. What I want to make clear is that I am pleading, no, begging for all to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke. Funny thing is that growing up we were always hungry because there was never enough and lunch was our largest meal. What do I have to do? Show everyone my bowl legs due to malnutrition? His legs which are worse? What lower level of indecency is required to quench their thirst for what I cannot fathom? </p> <p>Do you know what's a real bitch (I am welling with tears right now) is? I cannot physically go to see him and my mother. To come together as a family to support or call for fear of my immediate family being in physical danger. I can&rsquo;t go over there to bring groceries or have a private discussion.</p> <p>Proof: <a href="http://imgur.com/kvpzrK7">http://imgur.com/kvpzrK7</a></p> <p>Edit: I have found a picture of me and my brother. I hope this evidence is more concrete.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/11373483476_f77ae5f4b3_b.jpg"><img src="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/11373483476_f77ae5f4b3_b-300x234.jpg" alt="Photo credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/100239928@N08/" width="300" height="234"></a><p>Photo credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/100239928@N08/</p></div>As Mt.Gox was falling apart, the <a href="http://two-bit-idiot.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">&ldquo;Two-Bit Idiot&rdquo; blog on Tumblr</a> was one of the rare sources of well-sourced, reliable information. Written by self-professed &ldquo;entrepreneur and former VC&rdquo; Ryan Selkis (who also writes under the name Ryan Galt), the blog was the first to leak the <a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/mt-gox-offline-rumored-lost-744400-btc/">damning internal memos</a> that all but proved Mt.Gox was dead nearly a week before any official announcement.
<p>On Friday, Selkis took on another heavyweight in the cryptocurrency world, the Bitcoin Foundation In a post titled<br><a href="http://two-bit-idiot.tumblr.com/post/78868284696/coup-or-death-for-the-bitcoin-foundation" target="_blank">&ldquo;Coup or Death for the Bitcoin Foundation?&rdquo;</a> Selkis claims to have massively condemning material, and will publishing it on Monday unless Chairman Peter Vessenes and Executive Director Jon Matonis step down, effective immediately.</p>
<blockquote><p>Behind the scenes this week, I solicited the input of dozens of leaders throughout the industry who represent many of the corporate sponsors and lifetime individual members of the Foundation. The individual response has been nearly unanimous: these gentlemen must go, immediately. However, the corporate response has been understandably tepid. Truly good and professional executives have been caught between a rock and a hard place: Vessenes and Matonis are obstinate individuals who will be hard to force from their positions, and a public battle will cause additional media backlash for Bitcoin, which will hurt these executives&rsquo; businesses.</p>
<p>I have no similar fiduciary obligations to maintain the peace.</p></blockquote>
<p>What will happen if Selkis&rsquo;s ultimatum is ignored? He&rsquo;ll publish a full article on Monday, outlining the &ldquo;glaring incompetence and negligence&rdquo; of the two men in detail. Just to show he&rsquo;s not bluffing, Selkis even gave readers a taste of what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<blockquote><p>1) The Foundation never once warned Bitcoin investors about keeping deposits in Mt. Gox, despite clear red flags dating back to at least April 2013. Nor did the Foundation craft or advocate for best practices such as technical transparency, deposit audits, or appropriate consumer protection disclosures. This was a colossal failure of leadership. </p>
<p>2) There is evidence that Bitcoin Foundation board members may have had direct access to Mark Karpeles which allowed them to personally deposit and withdraw funds from Mt. Gox, despite persistent delays for other customers. </p>
<p>3) There is a troubling and inappropriate overlap between Peter Vessenes&rsquo; staff at his private company, CoinLab, and the Bitcoin Foundation&rsquo;s staff, which goes far beyond shared office space.   </p>
<p>4) The current leadership has shown a stunning disregard for proper communications with its members. The importance of immediate resignations (rather than gradual) is highlighted by the Board&rsquo;s secret plans to move the Foundation&rsquo;s headquarters to London without input from members and sponsors.</p>
<p>5) Peter Vessenes has had a nine month conflict of interest regarding Mt. Gox given that his company CoinLab was involved in an active multi-million dollar lawsuit against Mark Karpeles and Mt. Gox, following a failed partnership. Both men remained on the board of directors, and the Foundation failed to draft adequate by-laws that would allow them to address situations such as this where directors had material conflicts, which would compromise their ability to act in the best interests of its members.</p></blockquote>
<p>Selkis make it absolutely clear that his proposed change is non-negotiable.</p>
<blockquote><p>I assure you, I am ready to go nuclear. Because this is important. </p>
<p>Make no mistake: Peter and Jon will either step down from their leadership positions, or the corporate sponsors of the Foundation will quickly assemble and publicly distance themselves from the Foundation, writing off the organization as an illegitimate zombie entity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Will Vessenes and Matonis cave to the blogger and step down? Will Selkis air the Bitcoin Foundation&rsquo;s dirty laundry? All should be revealed on Monday. More on the situation as it develops.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>In a dramatic new survey by Viacom&rsquo;s brand research division Scratch, the mid-20s generation known as &ldquo;millennials&rdquo; have made their views about banks and the banking industry unambiguously clear: They don&rsquo;t like banks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Millenial-banking.jpg"><img src="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Millenial-banking-139x300.jpg" alt="Detail from the Scratch report." width="139" height="300"></a><p>Detail from the Scratch report.</p></div>In a dramatic new survey by Viacom&rsquo;s brand research division Scratch, the mid-20s generation known as &ldquo;millennials&rdquo; have made their views about banks and the banking industry unambiguously clear: <a href="http://www.millennialdisruptionindex.com/" target="_blank">They don&rsquo;t like banks.</a> Period. 
<p>The three-year study of 10,000 millennials, the &ldquo;Millennial Disruption Index,&rdquo; showed a general sense of skepticism and hostility towards banks. </p>
<p>According to the report, 33% of millennials believe they won&rsquo;t need a bank at all in coming years. All four leading banks rank in the &ldquo;ten least loved brands&rdquo; by millennials. A full 70% of those polled believe that payments will be &ldquo;totally different&rdquo; than today&rsquo;s system in a mere 5 years, and they believe this change will be &ldquo;seismic.&rdquo; Nearly half expect this change to come from tech startups.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3027197/fast-feed/sorry-banks-millennials-hate-you" target="_blank">Speaking with <em>Fast Company</em></a>, Scratch executive vice president Ross Martin explained the results:</p>
<blockquote><p>As consumers, millennials have been slow to accumulate wealth. They have huge debt. They&rsquo;re facing unprecedented underemployment. They&rsquo;ve been relatively unaddressed as a generation by banks. All of a sudden, you see purchasing power by millennials growing to over $1.3 trillion.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>As millennials become an increasingly powerful economic force, their view of banking has massive implications for alternative currencies and payments. The Fast Company report suggests that the likely winners of the coming battle for the wallets of millennial customers are non-bank options like PayPal, Square and, tellingly, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>No banks? Totally different payment systems? Tech-driven? It certainly sounds like the millennials are describing Bitcoin.</p>

The highlight of the presentation was a formal proposal to the government for &ldquo;Converting Cyprus into a worldwide hub for Bitcoin trading and processing.&rdquo;
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zw6x1/university_of_nicosia_proposal_to_the_cyprus/" target="_blank">translation posted to Reddit</a>, the proposal makes a powerful case for Cyprus to adopt progressive policies towards the rapidly growing cryptocurrency market.</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe that Bitcoin offers a significant opportunity for innovation and development: we would like to see Cyprus using its powerful human and academic capitals to become a pioneer in this regard.</p>
<p>All that the state has to do is to create a regulatory framework for Bitcoin businesses in Cyprus: this will eliminate/reduce the risks associated with digital currencies such as counterparty risk.</p>
<p>We can create an entirely new industry in Cyprus based on Bitcoin and digital currencies.</p>
<p>There will be major foreign investments in the economy, large annual income from its trading in the official Cyprus stock exchange and creation of new jobs.</p>
<p>Zero investment from the government.</p>
<p>The opportunity will not be there forever. Already other countries make similar moves e.g. Singapore, Switzerland, Denmark.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cyprus was on the front lines of the economic battles following the Greek debt crisis last year, and its population has been increasingly disillusioned with the state&rsquo;s banking system since the incredibly unpopular decision to &ldquo;haircut&rdquo; all bank deposits by 6.7% to nearly 40% as part of a 2013 bailout deal. While that decision was largely aimed at out-of-country depositors using Cyprus as a tax haven, the action has resulted in the steep decline of investment in the country and the moving of citizen funds to non-Cypriot banks. It has also resulted in a massive interest in alternative forms of currency like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>As a result, Cyprus is already well ahead of the curve when it comes to Bitcoin. The country is already home to first brick-and-mortar &ldquo;Bitcoin bank&rdquo; chain and payment company, <a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/bitcoin-bank-neo-opens-cyprus/" target="_blank">Neo &amp; Bee</a>, and University of Nicosia already accepts Bitcoin for tuition payments. The government, meanwhile, has made few moves to regulate virtual currency. Bitcoin prices are regularly shown on local TV news along with stock prices, and Bitcoin-based startups are appearing all over the country.</p>
<p>The idea of Cyprus as a haven for Bitcoin-related business is not far-fetched. The country&rsquo;s existing laws have long allowed Cyprus to serve as a shelter for foreign funds. According to the Reddit account of the conference, the Chairman of the Cyprus Stock Exchange expressed interest in the idea, although admitted to having almost no knowledge of Bitcoin. Neo &amp; Bee representatives offered any assistance needed to set up a workable system.</p>

Land of those who &ldquo;Live Free or Die&rdquo;. A place where some government owned roads have potholes deep enough to nearly flatten my car&rsquo;s tires during a night drive. But what are the free people of New Hampshire like?</p>
<p>I browsed the Internet and filed away stories of nanobreweries and porcupine quill crowns, and stumbled into a Facebook group dedicated to the Liberty Forum. The most noticeable pattern in the Facebook posts was the amount of people driving in from out of town. Several conference attendees were driving in from South Carolina, Michigan and other locations outside of New Hampshire. Others were members of the press, with requests being posted for Ben Swann&rsquo;s journalists who would need a ride from Logan Airport.</p>
<p><span>Several folks made reservations to sleep on the floor of those who booked hotel rooms at the Crowne Plaza where the Liberty Forum was held.</span></p>
<hr><p><strong><span><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Jeffrey_Tucker.jpg" width="343" height="387">Jeffrey Tucker</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I personally dislike bowties. But Jeffrey Tucker has a way of beating any haters of liberty (and bowties) down with elegance and charm. His first talk was concise and went through a talk called 10 Steps to Hack the Leviathan.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Notes from 10 Steps to Hack The Leviathan</span></em></p>
<p>Jeffrey talked about the softer subversive ways to Hack the Leviathan. He claimed centuries of work done by the government and lobbyists to limit choice and free markets can be undone in one Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p><span>1. Hack the House</span></p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Use <a href="http://mises.org/daily/5267/why-everything-is-dirtier">TSP</a> (trisodium phosphate) instead of bleach for laundry, dishes, and cleaning around the house.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>2. Hack Education</span></p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t bother with school</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Use the Khan Academy</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Use tablets to download millions of free books online available via the Gutenburg project and Laissez Faire Books (lfb.org)</p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>3. Travel</span></p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://liberty.me/"><span>Liberty.me</span></a></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>5. Leave Your Job</span></p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">People are afraid of leaving a bad job</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fear of losing health care</p>
</li>

</ul><p>8. Learn New Technology</p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">We can all learn new things</p>

<p dir="ltr">Read Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s white paper on a peer-to-peer cash transaction system (Bitcoin).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Over 400 cryptocurrencies in circulation</p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">Future can be brighter than the present</p>

<p dir="ltr">Satoshi didn&rsquo;t approach a central planner and didn&rsquo;t ask for permission. He just served others.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">States are cruel and stupid. Markets are smart</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The audience laughed and cheered through each of these points and Jeffrey&rsquo;s enthusiasm helped the talk fly by and made most people feel like the talk should have extended past the designated time slot.</p>
<p>One of the attendees asked Jeffrey if we were more free than 10 or 20 years ago. Mr. Tucker said, &ldquo;We have more choices, but are less free.&rdquo;</p>
<hr><p><a href="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo2.jpg"><img alt="photo2" src="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo2-620x465.jpg" width="620" height="465"></a></p>
<p><strong>Kashmir Hill</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I was very familiar with the Living 1 Week on Bitcoin series Kashmir published and I loved the story. I almost decided not to sit in on the talk, but as she began I realized it was much better to hear the story directly from the source, than to read online.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are a list of facts that I didn&rsquo;t remember reading in the online story:</p>
<p dir="ltr">- The first two food items she could purchase when she started her story was cupcakes and sushi.</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Buyers Best Friend began accepting Bitcoins (in store only) just because Kashmir Hill was living on Bitcoins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Jared Kenna provided her with shelter and his hostel was the only living space that accepted Kashmir&rsquo;s Bitcoins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finding a reliable means of transportation that would accept Bitcoin was a constant struggle the entire week. She paid her friend some Bitcoin for an old used bike.</p>
<p>She shared that she would be repeating the experiment on the anniversary of her first experiment to see if it was easier to live off Bitcoins in San Francisco one year later.</p>
<hr><p><a href="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo6.jpg"><img alt="photo6" src="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo6-620x465.jpg" width="620" height="465"></a><strong>The Liberator</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;One of the first 3d printer users to download Cody&rsquo;s liberator raised &nbsp;his gun as a packed room and the crowd cheered him on for &nbsp;exercising his freedom to print.</p>
<p>I also own a 3D printer and I looked forward to hearing the specifics on how the Liberator was &nbsp;designed and released. It is modeled after a .380 caliber gun and designed by an Electrical &nbsp; &nbsp;Engineer. Cody didn&rsquo;t have a Mechanical Engineer on hand, but this gentleman named John was &nbsp;available and determined to design the first 3D printed gun.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Initial test shots resulted in shredded the plastic gun due to several misfires and gave Cody and his team a bit of &nbsp;apprehension before calling the media (Andy Greenberg of Forbes and others) down to witness a &nbsp;successful test fire, but after choosing the right gun to model their gun after, finding a strong &nbsp;reliable spring design on thingiverse, and getting a second hand Stratasys Dimension SST 3D &nbsp;printer off ebay they had all they needed to finish the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>ABS vs. PLA</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">When I first did research on 3D printers, choosing ABS or PLA was a big question. ABS plastic was stronger, but was oil based and released hazardous fumes as it cooled. PLA plastic was corn based, but fragile and couldn&rsquo;t withstand high temperatures. I personally only use PLA since I have children in my home, but it is very common for ABS to be used for high force applications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Knowing the difference between the two types of plastics Cody had available is important, because to make a usable gun it is clear ABS is the only plastic that would be able to make strong enough springs and barrel to allow the gun to be fired multiple times. Cody was able to, with ABS, fire the Liberator 10 times before the barrel cracked. He taped it together and was then able to fire it one more time.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Bitcoin Public Addresses Over Ham Radio</strong></p>
<p><span>After a brief nap, I drove back to the Liberty Forum where I was expected to hear Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock.com, talk about his recent successes with Bitcoin, but he was unavailable due to health reasons, and the talk was delayed. Instead a stellar panel including Daniel Krawisz, Cody Wilson, and Chris Case talked about Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span>After the talk, I sat down with a lady who had several solar chargers and enough devices in her backpack to survive through an apocalypse. Her main concern with Bitcoins was, if the power grid went down in a region, how would people continue to transfer Bitcoins?</span></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a good answer, but the gentleman who sat with us showed us his ham radio he was selling for $100. He also had an iPhone app called PSKer. The app was a less powerful audio receiver and unlike like the chirp app, could decipher data encoded over specific frequencies designated spectrum.</p>
<p>We ran a test using a public Bitcoin Address, and it worked perfectly. I then turned to the survivalist lady and said, &ldquo;If some region did run out of power, they could use their ham radio to communicate their public address.&rdquo; The ham radio operator on the other end would have to be a trusted source.</p>
<p><span>According the FCC, ham radios can not be used for commerce; whether a Bitcoin public address could be seen as commerce is questionable. Someone could use it to confirm a balance for off-chain manually entered transactions in a rural region that has lost power.</span></p>

<p><strong>Tom Drake and The Whistleblowers</strong></p>
<p>I had never heard of many of the other whistleblowers besides Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, but of the modern whistleblowers, Thomas Drake was the first to draw media attention to the wasteful spending going on in the NSA and prove that this government organization had the resources to prevent the 9/11 attack.</p>
<p><span>He went to court and suffered for informing the public of this intel and he admitted some of his friends had suffered for his revelation. His lawyer is Jesselyn Radack who is also Edward Snowden&rsquo;s lawyer, and is also a whistleblower about the government&rsquo;s interrogation of John Walker Lindh without a lawyer present.</span></p>
<p>Thomas spoke of the first whistleblower in American history, Benjamin Franklin, and how he was penalized for intercepting letters to the Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson who called for an &ldquo;abridgement of English liberties&rdquo; and had been assisted by his brother-in-law General George Oliver in restricting the freedoms of British citizens living in Massachusetts.</p>
<p><span>Thomas referred to Ben Franklin because the letters which served as evidence were dismissed from Ben Franklin&rsquo;s trial. He was fired as the Postmaster and permanently sent back to the US. Thomas said that under this government all whistleblowers have suffered losses, whether it&rsquo;s having a spouse fired and forcing a family to live on food stamps or threatening someone with jail time as the threat pushes someone to commit suicide. Releasing government secrets to assist the public in knowing the truth always has negative personal consequences.</span></p>
<p>Jesselyn Radack was also the lawyer for John Kiriakou, who became a whistleblower after announcing to the press the methods which the CIA used to institutionalize torture. John&rsquo;s sister was in the audience and confirmed he was still in jail serving his 2.5 year sentence and misses being with his wife and 5 children.</p>
<hr><p><strong><span>Area 23</span></strong></p>
<p>All Liberty Forum attendees were invited to a second party in Manchester at a location called Area 23. This place was larger and thus more visible from the street, although someone told me I was entering through the wrong door. Again I followed the crowd to my destination, and this space seemed like more of a hangout, even though it was still under construction. To be honest, the unfinished rooms were quite appealing as most people chose to spend their time in areas with construction equipment and bare walls. The other rooms included Free State Project&rsquo;s office, a map room, an open black room, and an area with a pool table.</p>
<p><span>Near the food there was a dance floor where a few brave souls donning neon apparel danced to a playlist I heard even as I was pulling up into the parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span>The map room had a world map that covered one entire wall. It was close to 10 feet high and about 14-15 feet wide. I spoke to Zach and Josh Harvey, the developers of the Lamassu Bitcoin ATM and they talked about all the places in the world they were shipping their ATMs. I asked Josh how they tested different fiat currencies, and they told me they obtained the customers&rsquo; target currency and tested the ATM against a country specific firmware is installed to handle any currency. They pointed to all the places on the map where they had sent their ATMs.</span></p>
<p><span>The software used on the Lamassu is open source, and it could technically be configured to use software from the Dark Wallet or add support for other cryptocurrencies like AuroraCoin or Dogecoin.</span></p>
<p><span>We started talking about where we would go if we had to leave the US. At such a large scale, all the small islands around the larger continents were visible and we shared what we knew about these islands and how difficult it would be to migrate there.</span></p>
<p><span>While I was in the room, a gentleman approached me and pulled a slender shiny 10 ounce bar of silver out of his pocket. He wanted to exchange his silver for Bitcoin. This was my first ever informal silver offer, but I declined because I had just used Bitcoin to buy several silver coins from Amagi Metals hours earlier at the Liberty Forum.</span></p>
<hr><p><strong><span>A Chat with The Quill Queen a.k.a. Carla Gericke</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A large part of the Liberty Forum attendees were early Free State movers, and a lot of the buzz about the Free State project is due to Carla Gericke&rsquo;s leadership. I use the term leadership very liberally and I would say the Free State Project is full of a lot of leaders. Carla took some time to share some of the details of the Free State Project and talk about PorcFest.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ruben Alexander:</strong> <em>What did you enjoy the most about the 2014 Liberty Forum? What do you think you won&rsquo;t repeat again?</em></p>
<p><strong>Carla Gericke:</strong><span> Enjoyed the most? Definitely our keynote speakers. NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake and Jesselyn Radack, who represented Drake and is now representing Snowden, were amazing!</span></p>
<p><span>I was also excited by our Friday night keynote, Naomi Wolf, whom I personally recruited. I&rsquo;m thrilled that she joined us, and that she was totally enamoured with what we are achieving in New Hampshire. She called it &ldquo;ground zero for grassroots activism,&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s right. I wanted to bring Naomi out because part of this journey to freedom rests on us finding common ground with others. I believe progressives, or at least the ones asking the right questions, can be allies. This is no longer a left vs. right paradigm, it&rsquo;s an issue of liberty vs. tyranny. When Naomi spoke about being wrong on gun rights and the Second Amendment, and acknowledged that we need guns to protect individuals&rsquo; rights against the strong arm of the state, I knew we could continue the dialogue. I&rsquo;m excited to see where her next book takes her, and her new documentary, which is an update on her book &ldquo;The End of America.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also really enjoyed the Ignite talks, which was a first for us. The format&ndash;sticking to 5 minutes with 20 slides that auto-progress every 15 seconds&ndash;forced speakers to be succinct and on point. It was great to see what other activists are passionate about, with topics ranging from my own &ldquo;Art as Activism (Or How Not to Do an Ignite Talk),&rdquo; to &ldquo;How to Hitchhike in New Hampshire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>As to what not to repeat again, nothing really jumps out. The conference was well balanced, with topics covering economics, food freedom, legislature, moving to New Hampshire, philosophy, police state, secession, surveillance and privacy, social justice, technology, whistleblowing, and of course, Bitcoin. I&rsquo;m already thinking about 2015, and am, frankly, a little worried about how to top this one!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>RA:</strong> <em>I didn&rsquo;t see a dry eye when Thomas Drake and the other whistleblower&rsquo;s sister talked about the illusion of freedom in America and punishment for speaking the truth. Have there been any whistleblowers for matters local to the New Hampshire law enforcement or government? What protection do freestaters have in this circumstance?</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong>CG:</strong> You&rsquo;re right about not a dry eye&ndash;I cried too! It&rsquo;s very emotional to see the consequences of taking the moral high ground so personally, as human beings who are trying to protect and alert others to the emerging police state. Drake really impressed me with his unapologetic, forthright testimony against the national surveillance state, at great cost to himself.</span></p>
<p><span>There have been examples of local liberty lovers blowing the whistle. One of our speakers, Peter Martino, who spoke out at the Concord BEARCAT hearing about the federal government building a domestic army, whistleblew on waste and fraud in a warzone overseas. I believe he is under a gag order, and not a &ldquo;free stater&rdquo; per se, but he&rsquo;s one of us, a &ldquo;pre-stater,&rdquo; if you will. One of the many reasons we chose New Hampshire&ndash;no sales tax, no income tax&ndash;is because a desire for liberty still exists here.</span></p>
<p><span>We have had situations where activists&rsquo; actions have led to more transparency and accountability in law enforcement. Personally, I was arrested in 2010 for filming police officers in public, and my subsequent lawsuit against them is currently in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. The police chief of the town of Weare resigned, and two officers have been fired. It&rsquo;s hard to say definitively that my suit was the cause, but the new police chief did reach out through my attorney to acknowledge there are problems in the Weare police department.</span></p>
<p><span>During the Concord BEARCAT hearings last fall, it came to light that the then Concord police chief Duval had lied on a federal grant application for the acquisition of BEARCAT, calling Free Staters &ldquo;a domestic terrorist threat.&rdquo; Although the city ultimately voted to accept the BEARCAT, despite the will of more than 1,500 petition signers against it, Chief Duval quietly retired a few months later, and now works security for the Concord Hospital.</span></p>
<p><span>You can read more about the BEARCAT on www.freestateproject.org and here are some choice links:</span></p>

<p><span><strong>RA:</strong> <em>I heard the free state movement has 15,000 pledges. From what I saw the community is strong even though most folks who have signed the pledge haven&rsquo;t arrived. Do you know what locations are growing the most due to early movers? Do you have any insight into what town has the most free staters?</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong>CG:</strong> The FSP is now more than 75% to our goal of getting 20,000 activists to pledge to move to New Hampshire. Early movers have been coming to the state since the FSP started more than a decade ago, but there&rsquo;s definitely an acceleration happening, and even though no one is even obligated to move yet (you have 5 years after we reach the 20,000 mark), more than 1,500 people already have! With the successes we&rsquo;ve seen with this relatively small number of activists, imagine what is going to happen when we Trigger the Move!</span></p>
<p>Movers settle all across the state, but the largest concentration is in Manchester, NH&rsquo;s biggest city (pop. 110,000). The largest per capita concentration of Free Staters is in Grafton, which is a small, rural town with no zoning laws. There are also pockets in Nashua, which is close to the Massachusetts border and supplies FSP techies to the Boston area, and in Keene, which is a liberal college town.</p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong><em>Have Bitcoin donations helped with the expenses related to running the Free State Project?</em></p>
<p><span><strong>CG:</strong> The FSP was an early adopter of Bitcoin, and we started accepting payments in BTC to our events back in 2011, and BTC donations in 2012. We have a large Bitcoin community in New Hampshire, for example, the founders of Lamassu are Free Staters. We also have a lot of BTC related independent media that originates from here. We have received modest BTC donations in the past, and have had great relationships with BTC vendors as sponsors at our events. We appreciate the support! Of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if a Bitcoin millionaire wanted to step in and solve our immediate fundraising needs. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> <em>I read online you were originally from South Africa. Can you talk more about your background and what shaped your current views on the value in pursuing liberty in your community?</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CG:</strong> Yes, I was born and raised in South Africa, but also traveled a lot as a child as my father was a diplomat. Being able to see the &ldquo;free world&rdquo; while living in a police state formed many of my opinions. I was always a bit of a rebel, and never saw much sense in trying to control others. I won a green card in the mid-Nineties, and decided to immigrate to America. I have a distinct memory of the first time I took an internal business flight&ndash;this was probably 1996&ndash;and having been subjected to rigorous airport screenings growing up in South Africa&ndash;security theater&ndash;I arrived a couple of hours early, only to be told you can go through up to half an hour before your flight. This blew my mind! Fast forward to the post 9/11 world we live in, and the same police state scare tactics I saw under the apartheid regime, are now visible everywhere in the USA.</p>
<p><span>I come from a long lineage of people who don&rsquo;t take crap, and who moved time and time again for more freedom. My forefathers left Europe for more freedom in Africa. They then left the Cape in the Great Trek to get away from the British. I left South Africa for the promise of a brighter future in America. I left California for New York for more opportunity. I left NYC for New Hampshire to pursue Liberty in Our Lifetime. MY lifetime. Before signing up for the FSP, I researched other options&ndash;moving back to South Africa, going to Belize, Uruguay, Argentina, the informed know the drill&ndash;but ultimately I decided I wanted to make a stand. I wanted to held build a community of like-minded people to see if we can keep one little slice of America free. We are turning the tide, we picked the right state, and now all we need is more signers and movers. (And the funds to make it happen.) &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>RA:</strong> <em>Talk about the picture with Jason Soren&rsquo;s daughter handing you her allowance, which was a handful of pennies.</em></span></p>
<p><strong>CG:</strong> Talk about an evocative, happenstance moment! I was waiting for panelists to get miked, and decided to warm up the crowd and talk about how I was going to talk about our fundraising needs the next day. I was kind of goofing around, and said &ldquo;Gimme moneeeey! I need money!&rdquo; The founder of the FSP, Jason Sorens&rsquo; daughter, was playing in the back of the room. She heard what I said, dug out coins from her coat pocket, and started down the aisle to the stage. Her mom noticed in time, and stopped her since the panel had by now started, telling her she could talk to me afterwards. When I left the stage, this adorable 3 year old comes up to me, and says: &ldquo;You said you needed money. Take mine,&rdquo; and dropped a handful of pennies and dimes in my hand. I almost burst into tears!</p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong><em>Why should people consider attending PorcFest?</em></p>
<p><strong>CG:</strong> PorcFest XI will be even more epic than our tenth anniversary event last year, where we attracted more than 1,700 attendees. The Porcupine Freedom Festival is a week-long camping experience, with nearby motels and hotels, as well as park motels, for those who prefer a little more comfort.</p>
<p>PorcFest is liberty in action, the agora in motion, it is a truly free market. FRNs are the least favorite means of exchange, and people pay in gold, silver, Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies. You can walk down Agora Valley and buy some &ldquo;Lew Rocky Road&rdquo; ice cream with BTCs.</p>
<p><span>While we always attract world renowned speakers&ndash;I&rsquo;m delighted to announce that Overstock&rsquo;s Patrick Byrne will be one of our headline speakers&ndash;PorcFest 2014 will be focusing on &ldquo;DIY,&rdquo; self-reliance, instructional classes, and skill-building. Free Staters are, by their very natures, doers who like to execute on projects.</span></p>
<p><span>Some call PorcFest the &ldquo;Burning Man for libertarians,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s partly true, but it is also a family-friendly event. All we ask is that attendees take personal responsibility for their actions. It&rsquo;s a big tent event, drawing gun enthusiasts, religious folks, big and small Ls, politicos, anarchists, voluntaryists, entrepreneurs, the whole gamut participating together in classes, workshops, hikes, cook-offs, shooting expeditions, swimming, singing, etc. The beauty of PorcFest is that it shows that voluntary interactions free of force actually work, and it&rsquo;s a sight to behold.</span></p>
<p><span>Tickets are on sale for only $60 (accommodation at Roger&rsquo;s Campground in Lancaster, NH, is separate). You can get more information and buy your tickets at: </span><a href="http://porcfest.com/">porcfest.com</a><span>. Porcfest runs from June 22-29, 2014.</span></p>
<hr><p><span>I saw Amanda Billyrock after one of the final talks and realized I had Issue 16 (To The Moon) which included her interview. <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/10912/breakfastwithananarchist-amandabillyrock/">In the interview</a>, I closed the story with her invitation to come to the Liberty Forum. I accepted and realized that more of these sorts of invitation need to be given from us to others &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s an invitation to visit a local Bitcoin meetup, or to come and move to a state full of Anarchists and Libertarians. These invitations allow anyone who may be disillusioned with the world the opportunity to start a new chapter and enter a community that will help them thrive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">So, I invite you to check out the Free State Project and the growing Bitcoin community in New Hampshire by joining me at Porcfest or Liberty Forum in the future.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/10902/bitcoin-south-america-bitpay-opens-latin-american-headquarters/"><img width="784" height="504" src="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/argentinian-flag.png" alt="argentinian-flag"></a><p dir="ltr">As global popularity of Bitcoin grows, many Bitcoin companies are taking notice and expanding operations into other countries. Earlier this week, merchant payment processor BitPay announced the opening of its Latin America headquarters in Argentina. The expansion is one of the first for the Atlanta, Georgia based company and comes at an important time for the future of currency in the region.</p>
<p>In Argentina, BitPay will employ five software engineers in addition to business development manager, Alberto Liver Vega. &ldquo;As a technology enthusiast, I see Bitcoin as a big opportunity for companies to gain a competitive advantage,&rdquo; says Vega. &nbsp;&ldquo;BitPay is the perfect match and the natural platform for businesses to be able to use bitcoin easily and risk free in a voluntarily, open source and decentralized way.&rdquo; The company&rsquo;s Latin American headquarters will be located within The Bitcoin Embassy Buenos Aires, which contains the Fundaci&oacute;n Bitcoin Argentina and several other Bitcoin companies.</p>
<p>In a recent press release, BitPay also announced that Matias Alejo Garcia, nuclear engineer and founder of popular global movie recommendation site Cinefis.com, will lead the five-person development team in Argentina.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has enjoyed growing success within the region, which may be due to the instability of the Argentine peso, high e-commerce penetration, or the massive regulations surrounding purchasing US dollars. With these challenges, it is evident that change needs to occur and as Latin America&rsquo;s adoption of Bitcoin continues to grow, the country is beginning to see the benefit of utilizing the new currency. Currently, a range of businesses within Argentina and throughout Latin America accept Bitcoin, including hotels, new publications and a large number of e-commerce merchants.</p>
<p>The expansion will allow the continued growth of Bitcoin in Latin America and help decrease reliance on the Argentine peso, which is expected to devaluate another 50% by the end of the year. In fact, the value of the Argentine peso decreased 17% versus the American dollar (USD) in January 2014. Additionally, inflation within the region has increased over 25% annually, further establishing the importance of a new store of wealth within the country.</p>
<p>In a region plagued by staggering inflation and continuously decreasing currency value, it seems Bitcoin makes perfect sense. What the virtual currency provides allows for decreased dependence on the peso, and will enable businesses and individuals in the region to achieve sustainable wealth and future prosperity.</p>
<p>We have only begun to see the effect Bitcoin will have on Latin America. Either way, as more and more countries continue to support the adoption of Bitcoin, we will get a realistic glimpse at how nations can benefit from cryptocurrencies around the world. Organizations like the Bitcoin Embassy Buenos Aires, <a href="http://bitcoinargentina.org/">Fundaci&oacute;n Bitcoin Argentina</a> and BitPay will help support prosperity in Latin America by helping companies gain competitive advantage and spread Bitcoin knowledge throughout the nation.</p>

With a platform that is based on privacy, FreedomPop&rsquo;s Privacy Phone, nicknamed &ldquo;The Snowden Phone,&rdquo; allows mobile users to take advantage of encrypted mobile service.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/10899/freedompops-snowden-phone-mobile-service-built-privacy/"><img width="950" height="350" src="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/FreedomPop.jpg" alt="FreedomPop"></a><p dir="ltr">In a society that is increasingly reliant on mobility, the privacy of information is of utmost importance. Now, thanks to FreedomPop, there is a solution that gives mobile users government level security. With a platform that is based on privacy, FreedomPop&rsquo;s Privacy Phone, nicknamed &ldquo;The Snowden Phone,&rdquo; allows mobile users to take advantage of encrypted mobile service.</p>
<p>The Snowden Phone is able to protect your privacy from hackers, government agencies and spyware, ensuring your internet, voice calls and texts are secure and encrypted. In a company press release, FreedomPop stated, &ldquo;We launched the phone to specifically protect Americans&rsquo; privacy, thereby providing the peace and assurance [of] knowing your data is not being compromised. The phone is a response to the growing frustrations and concerns around privacy infringement, call monitoring and Internet tracking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For users, FreedomPop&rsquo;s service can provide peace of mind and ensure private information remains in the right hands. &ldquo;In light of recent violations in consumer&rsquo;s privacy across social networks and mobile devices, privacy is becoming increasingly important to many Americans and we all have a right to communicate anonymously,&rdquo; said Steven Sesar, COO at FreedomPop. &ldquo;Large carriers don&rsquo;t have the flexibility, desire or creativity to invest in privacy. We don&rsquo;t agree with this approach and felt it was up to us to create a truly private mobile phone service at an affordable price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Snowden Phone is one of the first of its kind and has benefits for both the common consumer and individuals in the many cryptocurrency communities. The platform behind the service leverages FreedomPop&rsquo;s VoIP network, and allows for private communication, anonymous internet and online security.</p>
<p>To ensure private communication, FreedomPop utilizes 128-bit encryption, which helps encrypt calls and text messages, prevents online marketers from tracking web activity and defends against data monitoring and eavesdropping, amongst many other benefits surrounding communication privacy.</p>
<p>The service also can protect users with advanced mobile security that protects your device from viruses and malware attacks. Additionally, FreedomPop can protect privacy by blocking unsolicited calls and text messages, and blocks malicious and phishing websites from accessing and stealing confidential data. Also, all application and internet data is sent through a secure and encrypted virtual private network (VPN).</p>
<p>The Snowden Phone costs $189 and is built on top of the Samsung Galaxy II smartphone. Service comes with unlimited voice and text, plus 500 MBs of data for three months and costs $10 each subsequent month after that.</p>
<p>Although FreedomPop&rsquo;s Privacy Phone may not be for everyone, there is no mistaking the importance of keeping your information out of the wrong hands. The nature of the information age makes anyone susceptible to confidential data theft and other attacks that spring forth from the increasing availability of sensitive personal information. What FreedomPop has provided is a solution to the problem, providing a device with built in VPN, anonymous voice and data, all of which can be purchased with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Like Bitcoin, FreedomPop seems to support the same foundations that cryptocurrencies have been built upon &ndash; security and anonymity using a platform that allows for world-wide adoption. By shining light on the importance of information protection, this service could change the way we think of personal security, which can be extended not only to mobility, but also the conventional methods we use to pay for goods and services.<br><a href="http://www.freedompop.com/theprivacyphone">http://www.freedompop.com/theprivacyphone</a></p>

Now, Bitcoin Decentral has announced that it is launching its newest program: a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency 2.0-specific startup accelerator.</p>
<p>The program, entitled <a href="http://bdaccelerate.com/">Bitcoin Decentral Accelerate</a>, is a standard three-month startup acceleration program, in which participating startups will be able work together at Bitcoin Decentral and enjoy the benefits of specialized in-house legal counsel, shared office resources and the assistance of and a number of expert mentors, investors, and business owners experienced in the cryptocurrency space. Startups will receive these benefits, alongside an upfront injection of a yet-to-be-determined quantity of cash, in exchange for a seven per cent stake in the company, and will also be eligible for an additional larger investment at the end of the three-month program. Managing the Bitcoin Decentral Accelerate program is A.

<p>On the weekend of February 21-23, the Berlin &amp; Texas Bitcoin Hackathon took place at the legendary hackerspace c-base in Berlin. The motto, Decentralize Everything!, was inspired by the recent projects aiming to bring the power of the blockchain to a broad range of applications. Many members of Berlin&rsquo;s vibrant Bitcoin community were there, joined by visitors from other cities.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/c-base.png"><img alt="c-base" src="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/c-base-620x410.png" width="620" height="410"></a></p>
<p><strong><span>Inside the Spaceship</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">c-base turned out to be an awesome location: It was founded in 1995 as one of the world&rsquo;s first hackerspaces and played an influential role in helping hackerspaces proliferate. It is also known for its close affiliation with the Chaos Computer Club, Europe&rsquo;s largest association of hackers, and more recently the German Pirate Party was founded there. As impressive as its history is its interiors: It felt as if we had stumbled into the large relaxation area of a gigantic spaceship drifting off into space.</p>
<p><span>The event started off on Friday evening with a welcome by JF Gallas, the organizer of the event. Then J&ouml;rg Platzer gave one of his signature motivational speeches. He is also the owner of Room 77, the world&rsquo;s first brick-and-mortar establishment to accept bitcoin, which provided great food throughout the weekend. Thomas Hessler, co-founder and former CEO of Zanox, talked about his new project UFOStart, the world&rsquo;s first global crowd network for lean startups, which was sponsoring the event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>From Berlin to Texas</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The hackathon was organized in collaboration with the upcoming Texas Bitcoin Conference in Austin, Texas on March 5 &amp; 6. The tantalizing prize for the top four hackathon competitors was a trip to the conference and a chance to compete in the Texas Bitcoin 2.0 Hackathon with UFOStart covering the flights and the Texas Bitcoin Conference covering local accommodation and conference tickets. Before people dove into their projects, Paul Snow of the Texas Bitcoin Conference sent a greeting message from Texas.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Voting Convolutions</span></strong></p>
<p><span>On Sunday, core Developer Mike Hearn came too to meet people and help out with the projects. Then the time for selecting the winning project came. One of the teams, Jeffcoin, had been building a Bitcoin-based voting system that we had planned to use for selecting the winners. Unfortunately, something wasn&rsquo;t working when it came to the voting and we had to look for alternative methods. (This was probably to the advantage of the other teams since Jeffcoin was admirably transparent about building a rigged system so only they could win.)</span> <span>Mike Hearn made the strange proposal of voting by a raise of hands, but the idea was dismissed by everyone for being ridiculously uncomplicated and not digital enough. Instead, we settled on voting by SMS and the service showed the tallies live on the big screen. It was a close race, but in the end Coinswap won, followed by Supporttr and Jeffcoin.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>1st place: Coinswap</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Coinswap was developed by Felix Weis of Bitalo, who programmed the backend, and Dennis Wilson, who created the UI. Coinswap uses multi-signature addresses to allow trading between coins of different cryptocurrencies. Here is how it works: Let&rsquo;s assume Alice wants to trade 2,000 Dogecoin with Bob for 1 bitcoin. They both meet on Coinswap, enter the details of the trade and are then shown QR codes. Alice pays her 2,000 DOGE into the multi-signature address and if Bob does the same with the bitcoin, the trade completes. If, however, Bob doesn&rsquo;t send the bitcoin, Coinswap uses its private key to sign a transaction that refunds Alice her 2,000 DOGE. Thus Coinswap can provide the same escrow functionality of an exchange like Cryptsy but does so in a decentralized, semi-trustless way using multi-signature addresses.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>2nd place: Supporttr</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The runner-up was an Android app called Supporttr created by Java developer Christian Rotzoll. Supporttr implements the idea of micro-donations pioneered by the Swedish app Flattr. Users can select a monthly donation level, for example 5 mBTC, and then add different projects and charities in the app. At the end of the month, the 5 mBTC are split and paid out to all the projects. Through giving projects between one and three stars, the app also allows adjustment of the share given to each project. While there were still many details to be worked out, such as generating a single transaction with multiple outputs instead of separate transactions for each donation, the concept of smooth, recurring donations is great.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>3rd Place &amp; Other Projects:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The third place went to the previously mentioned bitcoin-based voting system Jeffcoin by Callum MacDonald, Hubert Gertis, Meinhard Benn, and Benjamin Wilson. Some other great projects included Bookr, a cool 3D representation of Bitstamp&rsquo;s orderbook, by Jan Jorissen. Heinrich Erfurt and Dennis Mellman spent the weekend exploring Ethereum. Dirk J&auml;ckel and Gustav Simonsson built a Bitcoin SPV wallet that looked like a cat with Lego Mindstorms EV3. When one sent a transaction to the address of the cat, it waved its arm in return. Bj&ouml;rn G&uuml;nzel and Doris Schleibinger worked on a 3D-printed paper wallet egg that would have the private key inside the egg.</span></p>
<p><span>While they didn&rsquo;t quite manage to finish it, they announced a spectacular launch before Easter. Uwe Kamper built a website called &lsquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s do it&rsquo; to improve Bitcoin-based crowdfunding. Users are able to post a donation address and a progress bar is updated with the incoming transactions to show how much has been raised. Hubert Gertis also briefly introduced Qllect, his project to create colored coins backed by creative works.</span> <span>In the end the winning teams, Felix Weis and Dennis Wilson, Christian Rotzoll of Supportr and Callum MacDonald of Jeffcoin, all won trips to Texas and they&rsquo;ll be joined by Thomas Hessler and JF Gallas.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

But the confusion starts when clients go out into the world to start purchasing and trading the currency by themselves. Most clients return with a list of questions about how to best purchase bitcoin, which exchanges are the most reputable, and whether it&rsquo;s better to purchase through a BTM or from someone online, or if there&rsquo;s another way to go about it. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Here is a brief analysis on three ways to purchase bitcoin in Canada (and it&rsquo;s also applicable for citizens of other countries!). You will need a bitcoin wallet to use any of these methods.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><em>Tip!</em></strong> Recommended bitcoin wallet: <a href="https://blockchain.info/wallet/new" target="_blank">Blockchain</a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><em>Tip!</em> </strong>Please consult your financial planner or advisor before purchasing bitcoin to see if/where it fits into your financial plan.</p>
<p><strong><span>BTMs: Bitcoin ATM&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">BTM&rsquo;s are ATMs, but for bitcoin. The process is quite simple.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First, figure out if there is a BTM in your city (Google can help with this.) Next, go to your bank and withdraw the amount in cash that you will want to trade into BTC; because most, if not all, BTM&rsquo;s do not currently allow us to use our debit or credit cards. We must still feed cash into the machine to buy bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you arrive at the BTM with your cash in hand, follow the straightforward instructions on the machine to verify your personal information. All financial transactions require what is called KYC compliance &ndash; &ldquo;know your client&rdquo; &ndash; so you will have to enter your mobile number, name, e-mail address, the like.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, link your wallet API key (example: 14BwoQ4d6kVZCkdCZnrnryjGeww8NzAVxQ)&nbsp;enter the amount of bitcoin you would like to buy, feed the machine the equivalent<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money" target="_blank"> fiat </a>(CAD, USD, etc) money, and you&rsquo;re in! Congratulations! <a href="http://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-s-first-bitcoin-teller-machine-1.1642877">Ottawa</a>, <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/01/13/bitcoin_atm_comes_to_toronto.html">Toronto</a>, <a href="http://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/winnipeg-s-first-bitcoin-atm-now-accepting-cash-1.1688529">Winnipeg</a> and <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/world-s-first-bitcoin-atm-opens-in-vancouver-1.2286877">Vancouver</a> are a few Canadian cities that currently have BTMs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Pros:</em> &nbsp;Very fast; very convenient.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Cons:</em> Rates tend to be higher; BTM companies take a spread on the transaction; safety is challenging when carrying around large amounts of cash.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Tip!&nbsp;</strong></em>Consider bringing a friend with you when you go to the BTM if you are depositing a large amount of cash.</p>
<p><strong>Peer-to-Peer:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is really what Bitcoin was designed for &ndash; the direct transfer of value from one individual to another without a third party intermediary. You can buy and sell bitcoin to people by finding them through friends or on the internet. Use a site like <a href="http://www.localbitcoins.com/">Local Bitcoins</a> to discover individuals who are willing to sell bitcoin to you. You can typically pay these individuals in person with cash (recommended!) or using many online methods, including Interac e-Transfer and wire transfers &nbsp;(but be careful, there are many reports of scams when it comes to online transfers.) That being said, <a href="http://www.localbitcoins.com/">Local Bitcoins</a> is a Twitter community favourite and currently operates in over 5,280 cities and in over 215 countries, so there is likely a community near you to buy into.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Pros:</em> &nbsp;Easy to find buyers/sellers. &nbsp;No fees. &nbsp;Ability to buy at different prices from a variety of different individuals. Many online and offline purchase options.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Cons:</em> &nbsp;Sometimes people feel uncomfortable trading with others directly, due to lack of personal information. This lack of personal information can lead to <a href="http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/2014/02/07/warning-localbitcoins-com-high-volume-dealers-are-being-arrested-for-violating-state-msb-laws/">law enforcement entrapments</a> and potential fraud, scams and identity theft.</p>
<p><strong>Exchanges:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Like buying and selling stocks, exchanges exist to buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The most important part of using an exchange is really doing your research in deciding which exchange to use. Recently we have had some issues in the bitcoin world with two exchanges &ndash; <a href="http://www.mtgox.com/">Mt. Gox</a>, which WAS located in Japan, and <a href="http://www.bitstamp.net/">BitStamp</a>, located in the UK; individuals were having problems taking their money out, and the sites suffered from what is called transaction malleability (which you can read more about <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/what-you-need-to-know-about-mt-gox-and-the-bitcoin-software-flaw">here</a>.)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Update!:</em> Mt. Gox is now shut down. &nbsp;Please <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/10843/3-principles-business-success-review-vault-satoshi/" target="_blank">read here</a> for a reputable Canadian exchange that you may want to consider. &nbsp;They allow you to send money from your bank account to their exchange.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other exchanges that are popular include <a href="https://btc-e.com/">BTC-E</a> and <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>. &nbsp;If you are a Canadian, you are unable to link your bank account to Coinbase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Establishing an account with an exchange is similar to opening a stock account: sign up using your e-mail address, send in the required verification items (government issued ID, such as a drivers license, passport, SIN/SSN, etc.) and wait for your account to be verified. &nbsp;Some exchanges are now allowing us to link our bank accounts with their exchanges, but most will require you to wire money into them.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><em>Tip!</em></strong> Once you&rsquo;ve transacted into bitcoin or another currency, transfer your money out of the exchange and keep it in your own secure wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Pros:</em> Trade at any time, anywhere, usually in any amount. Assumed level of protection in working with a third party.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Cons:</em>&nbsp; Fees. &nbsp;It takes time to open an account with a fairly lengthy verification process. &nbsp;Lack of regulation. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t do your homework (or even if you think you have), you may still be <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2014/03/after-mt-gox" target="_blank">subject to theft</a>!</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Overstock.com announced that it surpassed $1 million in purchases using Bitcoin. This news came at an important time, further establishing the company as a leader in the e-commerce space. For many, Overstock and other large retailers gave people a reason to start using Bitcoin. Being able to offer an additional payment method gives merchants the chance to stand out in the crowd. And because individuals within the Bitcoin community enjoy trying new things, most businesses see increases in sales.</p>
<p>For Overstock and other merchants, the real value add comes from the potential to attract additional customers. In January, new and existing Bitcoin users were provided a source to spend their digital cash, a majority of which were new users. According to a company statement, &ldquo;over 60 percent of sales were from new customers.&rdquo; Additionally, more than 4,300 consumers made purchases using Bitcoin on Overstock.com in only two months.</p>
<p><em>What other currency could provide this type of growth?</em></p>
<p>Bitcoin allows businesses to engage with an expanding market, filled with passionate individuals willing to try virtually anything. For most within the Bitcoin community, Overstock.com was something they had heard of, but never used. When the announcement was made in January, Bitcoiners everywhere wanted to be part of the action. Although Bitcoin consists of less than a percent of the company&rsquo;s sales, CEO Patrick Byrne is optimistic, stating in an interview that he expects Bitcoin sales to reach up to $15 million by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In addition to growing sales and new customers, Byrne also believes that over time, there will be a derivatives market for Bitcoin that allows commercial end-users like retailers to hedge their risk. This could create and establish a completely different business venture for Overstock, which could cause many other companies to follow suit. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Overstock stated, &ldquo;In the future, we expect to transact in Bitcoins directly and intend to hold Bitcoins. This will subject us to exchange risk which may have an adverse effect on our results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As one of the first major online retailers to accept the virtual currency, their support for the growth and further adoption of the Bitcoin ecosystem is obvious. Overstock currently holds ten percent of each transaction in Bitcoin, and in the future intends to offer it as payment for vendors and employees.</p>
<p>Overstock.com is a great example of how Bitcoin can revolutionize the way we do business. Bitcoin puts the power back into the hands of the business owner and can play a major role in a company&rsquo;s growth, further establishing a global marketplace. The implications of virtual currency also give businesses the ability to securely transact with customers around the world. The example set by Overstock and the tens-of-thousands of Bitcoin merchants will assist in forging the path for future adoption of Bitcoin, for both e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses. Will Overstock reach $15 million by year&rsquo;s end, or have they underestimated again?</p>

A <a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/1dda0f8827518ce4d1d824bf7600f75ec7e199774a090a947c58a65ab63552e3" target="_blank">long-dormant address moved 180,000 BTC</a> (around $113,500,000 at today&rsquo;s price) to several other addresses, and then those split even further. The initial address has several connections to Mt.Gox, fueling <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zshct/4ee89f7cf824a85ad5f11d52604ffdebe9f01302bcea8ddec0/" target="_blank">rampant speculation</a> about who is moving this massive amount of BTC and why.
<p>There are three major theories floating around at the moment:</p>
<p><strong>1: The address controlled by Mark Karpeles.</strong> It has long been rumored that Karpeles has personal stockpile of around 200,000 BTC, which would fit the transaction amount. The address has several Mt.Gox connections, as one would expect from the personal account of the CEO. Why would he be moving the money? Is he splitting it up to avoid it being seized by authorities? Or, as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zshct/4ee89f7cf824a85ad5f11d52604ffdebe9f01302bcea8ddec0/cfwnd2v" target="_blank">Redditor nullc theorizes</a>, is he putting it back into the Mt.Gox hot wallet in an attempt to restart the bankrupt exchange?</p>
<blockquote><p>People have been asking on IRC why some of it is being broken up. I could only speculate &mdash; but that&rsquo;s what you need to do to prepare a hotwallet to support a high volume of transactions (so you have many coins to spend so you don&rsquo;t get stuck waiting for your change to confirm while avoiding spending unconfirmed change, which MTGox has always done). &hellip; Sturles pointed out to me that the splitting behavior is consistent with the splitLargeOutputs function in the leaked gox source code, suggesting that portion of the coins was dropped into the MTGox online wallet and the system is now automatically breaking it up.</p></blockquote>
<p>A variation on this theory is that the address does belong to Karpeles, and is being run through the Mt.Gox system, but only as a precursor to trading those coins to pay for the company&rsquo;s looming legal battles. In this case, the splitting of the BTC is simply what the Mt.Gox system does by default. Running his personal funds through the system would simply be a way of obscuring the source of those funds, or would have been had the Bitcoin community not dogpiled it.</p>
<p><strong>2. The address is controlled by the Mt. Gox hackers,</strong> who somehow gained access to the private keys to a massive old Mt.Gox wallet. While there were no reports of this happening, Karpeles did claim that the Mt.Gox funds were &ldquo;temporarily unavailable&rdquo; rather than stolen at one point. If this is true, the various test transactions from the now-broken-up BTC funds to <a href="http://bitzillions.com/satoshibones" target="_blank">addresses associated with gambling site Satoshibones</a> might represent a test of the hackers ability to &ldquo;launder&rdquo; the BTC through online gambling.</p>
<p><strong>3. Anyone else, for any number of reasons.</strong> Some other massive old address, only tangentially related to Mt.Gox, is moving coins for some other purpose. Perhaps it&rsquo;s another exchange creating a hot wallet. Maybe it&rsquo;s an early adopter of Bitcoin spreading the risk that any one address could become compromised. Maybe it&rsquo;s even Satoshi Nakamoto himself telling us all that he&rsquo;s more <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zsr6g/the_megahuge_addresses_tied_to_gox_that_just_got/" target="_blank">&ldquo;31337&Prime;</a> than the rest of us.</p>
<p>In any case, this transaction represents the largest <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Days_Destroyed" target="_blank">&ldquo;days destroyed&rdquo;</a> (volume of coins times days since those coins were spent) in Bitcoin history It&rsquo;s a relevant indicator of Bitcoin transaction volume, and with 143,132,916.67 Bitcoin days destroyed by this single, mysterious transaction, you can be sure there&rsquo;s only more speculation to come.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MazaCoin.jpg"><img src="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MazaCoin.jpg" alt="MazaCoin logo" width="256" height="256"></a><p>MazaCoin logo</p></div>Last month, the seven bands of the Lakota Nation adopted their homegrown Bitcoin variant, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasperhamill/2014/02/27/the-battle-of-little-bitcoin-native-american-tribe-launches-its-own-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank">MazaCoin, as their official currency</a>. The new virtual currency joins a slew of similarly local projects, such as <a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/auroracoin-becomes-third-largest-virtual-currency/" target="_blank">Iceland&rsquo;s rapidly rising Auroracoin</a>, in the ever-growing cryptocurrency community. What makes <a href="http://www.mazacoin.org/" target="_blank">MazaCoin</a> interesting, however, is that the Lakota Nation is technically a sovereign nation inside the U.S., meaning that their currency is unambiguously legal tender.
<p>On the Lakota reservations, at least. But what that really means is still very much in development.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5469510/native-americans-assert-their-independence-through-cryptocurrency-mazacoin" target="_blank">In a story published on The Verge</a>, writer Adrianne Jeffries spoke with programmer and Native American activist Payu Harris, who believes that MazaCoin might be the key to empowering Native American populations currently marginalized by the reservation system. </p>
<blockquote><p>Half the tribal members on Harris&rsquo;s reservation, the Oglala Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, live in poverty. It&rsquo;s a problem that afflicts tribes across the country as Native Americans have grown dependent on federal welfare after being ghettoized on reservations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noting the unifying power of a common, nationally owned and controlled currency, Harris believes that a Lakota-owned currency might be a game changer. Instead of seeing the estimated $220 million that flows through the reservation each year go into the pockets of Wal-Mart, it might actually stay in the hands of the tribe.</p>
<blockquote><p>But perhaps more than that, it will give the Lakota people a sense of unity and independence. &ldquo;Our tribe has an idea of what sovereignty is, but &hellip; [there] is no sense of national identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not everyone is convinced that MazaCoin is such a good idea, however. When it comes to Native American economic freedom, the U.S. government&rsquo;s track record speaks for itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>But Chase Iron Eyes, South Dakota legal counsel for the Lakota, believes the federal government will push back if MazaCoin succeeds. &ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been a tribal nation that has declared its own currency and has mandated that that currency is used within its borders,&rdquo; Iron Eyes says. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s because of this pervasive, ever-present asserted dominion of the United States. They&rsquo;ll try to shut us down, try to cite us with law violations.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Will MazaCoin join the ranks of Bitcoin, Litecoin, or even Dogecoin, in the virtual currency mainstream? If so, it won&rsquo;t happen any time soon. It seems that the Lakota tribes, while supportive of the idea in theory, have little ability to actually implement their new currency. In a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasperhamill/2014/02/27/the-battle-of-little-bitcoin-native-american-tribe-launches-its-own-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank">recent article on <em>Forbes</em></a>, contributing writer Jasper Hamill also profiled MazaCoin.</p>
<blockquote><p>Understandably, there&rsquo;s a bit of confusion about what exactly this new currency is going to do for the impoverished Lakota people. When I contacted them, tribal elders declined to speak about MazaCoin, instead referring me back to Harris. However, there is certainly support for the scheme, as well as bewilderment. Other tribes from around America have already contacted Harris to wish him well and express an interest. The project has allegedly gathered enough steam to attract the attention of the FBI, which phoned the Lakota chief to warn him that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aren&rsquo;t actually legal yet.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s a long way to go for MazaCoin, which is currently just one of many alt-coins battling to become valuable. Without the support of the world&rsquo;s crypto-community, it will be just another worthless bundle of numbers.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of this story, no major exchanges traded in MazaCoin, including <a href="https://poloniex.com/" target="_blank">extremely diverse platforms like Poloniex</a>. Payu Harris was recently selling MazaCoin at real-world virtual currency exchange The Bitcoin Center in New York for $0.10 each. <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank">Coinmarketcap.com</a> currently places the value closer to $0.03, with a total market capitalization of $3,202,279. It was also unclear if any business in the Traditional Lakota Nation actually accepted the virtual currency.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/duydol7lpdsrh0kofyui.png"><img src="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/duydol7lpdsrh0kofyui-300x224.png" alt="duydol7lpdsrh0kofyui" width="300" height="224"></a>Yesterday, Newsweek published a story by reporter Leah McGrath Goodman claiming to have located the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Within hours of that story&rsquo;s publication, the <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-man-denies-hes-bitcoin-founder?new" target="_blank">Associated Press released their own version of the story</a>, with an extensive interview with Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who claims he had nothing to do with the creation of Bitcoin, and only heard about it three weeks ago after his son was interviewed by Newsweek. Neither side seems willing to give any ground, and given Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s largely unknown past, speculation has been running rampant. Is the man in the Newsweek profile <em>the</em> Satoshi, or isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>The following is a collection of conflicting perspectives on that subject from the last 24 hours. There are no clear answers here, but perhaps you can draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/447DSVApZPY" target="_blank"><em>Newsweek&rsquo;s</em> Goodman talking about her story</a> with <em>International Business Times</em> about her story.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-man-denies-hes-bitcoin-founder?new" target="_blank">Leah McGrath Goodman&rsquo;s response</a> to the AP story publishing Dorian S. Nakamoto&rsquo;s claim that he is not the creator of Bitcoin.http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-man-denies-hes-bitcoin-founder?new</p>
<p>A post today <a href="http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?id=2003008%3ATopic%3A9402&amp;page=2#comments" target="_blank">from Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s P2P Foundation Ning account</a> on a thread he began in February of 2009, stating simply &ldquo;I am not Dorian Nakamoto.&rdquo; If valid, this would be the first public statement the Bitcoin creator has made in three years.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/GrrtA6IoR_E" target="_blank">Video of Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, the man <em>Newsweek</em> claims is the Bitcoin inventor, denying that he has anything to do with Bitcoin and refuting Leah Goodman&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was, however, determined to get his promised free lunch.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/DB4oq5s.png" target="_blank">A comparison of Dorian S. Nakamoto and Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s writing</a> from existing internet sources. There are stark differences between the two.</p>
<p>An early Bitcoin adopter tells a story <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7354326" target="_blank">about possibly meeting Satoshi Nakamoto in 2011</a>, at one of the first Bitcoin-accepting locations in the world. The man they met? Dead ringer for the <em>Newsweek</em> Satoshi.</p>
<p>A statement from the <a href="https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/?p=510" target="_blank">Bitcoin Foundation core developers</a> that they&rsquo;re not convinced that Dorian Nakamoto is Satoshi Nakamoto. Even if he was, the team wouldn&rsquo;t know, as Nakamoto communicated purely through electronic means.</p>
<p>What if Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym? <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/one-simply-find-satoshi-nakamoto/" target="_blank">CoinDesk runs down the list of likely candidates for the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Satoshi.</a></p>
<p>Unless a smoking gun document or connection comes to light, it&rsquo;s unlikely the truth about Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto will be known any time soon. More on this story as it develops.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div><a href="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/VaultOfSatoshi.jpg"><img src="http://www.bitcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/VaultOfSatoshi.jpg" alt="Vault of Satoshi's logo." width="256" height="256"></a><p>Vault of Satoshi&rsquo;s logo.</p></div>Canadian cryptocurrency exchange <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zr5o7/vault_of_satoshi_to_cease_us_operations_starting/" target="_blank">Vault of Satoshi announced today that it would be halting all U.S. operations</a>, effectively immediately. Citing concerns about the &ldquo;increasingly hostile&rdquo; regulatory environment in the U.S., the exchange announced their decision via their Facebook page.
<p>The post also mentioned the warnings of Bitcoin Foundation and BitInstant founder Charlie Shrem in a <a href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/e87-the-captive-and-the-mountain/#.Uxk9AIUxi8A" target="_blank">recent episode of the &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk Bitcoin&rdquo; podcast</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest concern for Vault of Satoshi seems to be compliance with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury tasked with combating domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Like most regulatory bodies, FinCEN has had a seemingly unclear, and even seemingly contradictory, set of policies for handling virtual currencies.</p>
<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve made repeated attempts to comply with FinCEN regulations, but their online form submission process will not allow us to post reports from our headquarters in Ontario, Canada. They refuse to accept printed paper reports, and their drop-downs don&rsquo;t include Canadian options, making it impossible to the file the required documentation properly in order to comply. Despite repeated inquiries into how to properly file reports from Canada, we have yet to receive a satisfactory response. They&rsquo;ve literally made it impossible for us to run our business in compliance with their regulations.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The news does not mean that U.S. Vault of Satoshi customers are out of luck, however. The post went on to note that when the &ldquo;regulatory situation is clarified and settles down&rdquo; the company will relaunch U.S. service, possibly on a state-by-state basis. In the meantime, however, new U.S. customers will not have their accounts verified, and will soon be limited to coin-to-coin trading. Any remaining U.S. funds will be refunded via check.</p>
<p>The regulatory situation in Canada currently seems even more uncertain than in the U.S., as C<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/canadas-finance-minister-regulate-bitcoin/" target="_blank">anada&rsquo;s Finance Minister Jim Flaherty recently made seemingly hostile remarks about Bitcoin</a>.</p>

<p>It should be applicable to the following case:</p>

<p>Many peers and nobody trusts each other. But trust is gained by investing bitcoins in that system. 
Nobody should be able to withdraw more money, than they invested.</p>

<link><![CDATA[https://pay.reddit.com/r/bitmessage/comments/1zr8bu/would_you_trust_bitmessage_for_status_updates/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>So, I've been using this as a cool little "let's test it out" for awhile, but, I've yet to use it for anything serious. As of a new computer I'm setting up, it'll have to send me updates when the UPS it's attached to fails (I.E. power failure, power restored, or, unknown failure (Such as dead UPS battery)). Now, as this box won't be monitored 24/7, I'd like to be notified when something occurs, now, most people would go one of two ways:-</p> <ol><li>Email notifications</li> <li>SMS notifications</li> </ol><p>I'm honestly considering using bitmessage, purely because I want to give it a shot at actually being useful, rather than being a toy to me. I'm decent at programming in different languages, so, it shouldn't be too hard to setup an interface between apcupsd and bitmessage's JSON-RPC, so, the only limitation is really "Will it hold up to the job"?</p> <p>I don't really care if tomorrow there's a security leak and everyone can read that my UPS has two hours of power left in it, and/or that it just had a failure, as, it's not all that private (And, wouldn't be connectable to me, but, even if it was, what of it?).</p> <p>So, a few technical pieces of information about the actual configuration in question:-</p> <ol><li>After the "Power failure" event occurs (I.E. the only one where the computer won't be on for an extended period of time after the event), the computer automatically shuts down after forty minutes (Roughly), unless power is restored.</li> <li> Internet may or may not fault at the same time as power (This isn't a data center, if it's a large enough power-cut, there may be issued with the ISP and/or nodes connecting me to my ISP)</li> </ol><p>And related questions to the above two statements:-</p> <ol><li>If the computer transmitting the message manages to transmit it to the network and then shuts down, but, the receiving computer isn't on at the time, will the receiver still manage to get the message if his computer turns on within the next 24 hours (While the transmitter/sender is still offline)?</li> <li>If the net does die at the same time as the power failure event, this means bitmessage won't be able to transmit the message after the proof-of-work is done, and, the computer will shutdown. When the computer is powered back on, and, internet is restored (This may be multiple hours/days/weeks/months later), will bitmessage remember it never managed to send the message, and, transmit it then?</li> </ol><p>And, I suppose:-</p> <ol><li>Would <strong>YOU</strong> actually trust/use bitmessage for this?</li> </ol><p>tl;dr Read the three statement under "And related questions to the above two statements".</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/B24Cd5JU0pm9O7pxrw7n"> B24Cd5JU0pm9O7pxrw7n </a> <br><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitmessage/comments/1zr8bu/would_you_trust_bitmessage_for_status_updates/">[link]</a> <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/bitmessage/comments/1zr8bu/would_you_trust_bitmessage_for_status_updates/">[5 comments]</a>]]></description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/10857/dawn-national-currency-exploration-country-based-cryptocurrencies/"><img width="900" height="450" src="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/altcoin.jpg" alt="altcoin"></a><p dir="ltr">In less than twenty days Auroracoin, Iceland&rsquo;s own national cryptocurrency, will be distributed throughout the entire population of Iceland. The &ldquo;Airdrop&rdquo; commencing at midnight March 25th marks the first local cryptocurrency to be distributed country-wide. Will Auroracoin establish the trend of country-based cryptocurrencies? In reality, it seems to be the case, with local currencies like MazaCoin and private money like Evergreen, all centered on a combination of various cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Recently, the Lakota Tribe residing in areas of North and South Dakota have began adopting MazaCoin, a Bitcoin derivative, as its national currency. The confederation of seven Sioux tribes have created MazaCoin with the hope that it will help lift the tribe out of poverty.</p>
<p>MazaCoin is a fork of ZetaCoin and unlike Bitcoin, is inflationary, making it possible for new coins to be mined over time. This is a controversial aspect of the new virtual currency, but according to a recent Forbes interview with Bitcoin developer Payu Harris, &ldquo;I think crypto-currencies could be the new buffalo. Once, it was everything for our survival. We used it for food, for clothes, for everything. It was our economy. I think MazaCoin could serve the same purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lakota nation has pre-mined 25 million MazaCoin as a national reserve, and an additional 25 million to establish a Tribal Trust, which will issue grants to local businesses and tribe members. Because MazaCoin is pre-mined, the computer power required is drastically reduced, making it more environmentally friendly and sustainable for the Oglala Lakota Nation.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean for citizens?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Local cryptocurrencies like MazaCoin and Auroracoin have the ability to give every citizen the chance of ownership. Currencies such as these allow for the future redistribution of wealth, especially in regions like the Oglala Lakota Nation. Additionally, country-based currencies also can spawn growth of local commerce. With MazaCoin, businesses and citizens can reduce their dependence on the dollar, and instead establish wealth that puts individuals in control.</p>
<p>For societies like many Native American tribes, poverty continues to be an issue. Within the community, many believe that this can be overcome by establishing local cryptocurrencies. For instance, Payu Harris believes that MazaCoin will help alleviate poverty by propelling the Lakota Tribe into the global market, stating in a recent interview, &ldquo;This is going to be the next generation of payment processing, investments, currency transactions. We will become the working model for a world-wide embracement of cryptocurrencies in general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much like Bitcoin, these currencies have the ability to make global payments possible and can redistribute wealth in ways that conventional means cannot. However, local currencies are under continued scrutiny and can pose many future challenges, both nationally and individually.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages and challenges</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Many question the implementation of local cryptocurrencies, and in tribal nations especially, the main challenge lies in the current volatility of virtual currencies. Some believe cryptocurrency is not the solution for tribes, simply because they can&rsquo;t afford to invest in anything that consistently changes value. That being said, <a href="http://www.mazacoin.org/">MazaCoin</a>, <a href="http://auroracoin.org/">Auroracoin</a>, and <a href="http://evr.gr/">Evergreen</a> may be an exception. Because the value of each is supported by individuals within the country or region, the question of volatility may not carry much weight.</p>
<p>Another challenge, as we have seen with Bitcoin, is the challenge of government intervention. For communities like the Oglala Lakota Nation, having complete control of a local currency without the risk of government involvement is very important. &ldquo;I want to get my people educated and show them this is the next level of finance,&rdquo; Harris stated. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make the rest of the world play catch up. Let&rsquo;s be leaders and rebuild the economy on our terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>A viable future?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Re-establishing a national economy based on cryptocurrency may hold the key to individual financial responsibility and decreased reliance on conventional stores of wealth. Countries like Iceland and the Oglala Lakota Nation are some of the first to make an attempt at the idea, and the future will only tell what becomes of local currencies.</p>
<p>The increasing individual support within these regions can help the acceptance of virtual currencies throughout the world. Whether you are a believer in pre-mining and eco-friendly cryptocurrencies, or you believe that Bitcoin is the only solution, constant innovation is a catalyst for progress. MazaCoin, Auroracoin, other local currencies, altcoins and Bitcoin don&rsquo;t have to compete- instead, focus should be on a viable future, no matter the payment protocol.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Blockchain.info Launches ZeroBlock Trading Platform RTBTC]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoinmagazine.com/10860/blockchain-info-zeroblock-rtbtc/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This week Blockchain.info showed us just how easy it is to acquire a company.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/10860/blockchain-info-zeroblock-rtbtc/"><img width="949" height="350" src="http://btcmag.9wizards.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/zeroblock.png" alt="zeroblock"></a><p dir="ltr">This week Blockchain.info showed us just how easy it is to acquire a company. The company purchased the encrypted currency trading platform RTBTC, in what was the first 100% Bitcoin acquisition. From the buyout of <a href="https://rtbtc.com/">RTBTC</a>, <a href="https://blockchain.info/">Blockchain.info</a> has launched the ZeroBlock trading platform, combining a world class currency trading platform with the most popular Bitcoin mobile app.</p>
<p>The undisclosed amount of the all-Bitcoin sale will be distributed over a period of time to compensate for the volatility of the virtual currency. This will allow for ZeroBlock, subsidiary of Blockchain.info and leading market price aggregator and news app, to completely acquire the company. Dan Held, co-founder of ZeroBlock and Director of Product of Blockchain stated in a recent press release, &ldquo;Acquiring RTBTC was a perfect fit for ZeroBlock&rsquo;s existing product. Our features and services are highly complimentary, and we are excited to bring additional functionality to our users.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RTBTC was built by Clark Moody, one of the best and brightest in the Bitcoin economy, and after the acquisition, Blockchain hired him to head up product strategy and vision for ZeroBlock. The ultimate goal is to build a comprehensive trading platform for Bitcoin, an attempt to build &ldquo;the Bloomberg of Bitcoin,&rdquo; explained Blockchain CEO Nic Cary. ZeroBlock, which Blockchain acquired in December, hopes to be a professional-level trading platform with both mobile and desktop versions.</p>
<p>Since RTBTC launched in July 2013, the company has facilitated over $150 million in trading volume across multiple exchanges, further solidifying the decision for ZeroBlock to acquire the company. When paired with Blockchain&rsquo;s over 1.1 million users, the platform that RTBTC adds to ZeroBlock will continue to allow the spread of information between individuals and create a unique approach to Bitcoin trading.</p>
<p>For both veterans and newcomers to Bitcoin, ZeroBlock has the ability of becoming the most popular trading platform based on reputation alone. The current ZeroBlock app has over 10,000 daily users and is the most downloaded Bitcoin mobile application, with over 55,000 downloads between iOS and Android. For users wanting unlimited trading, ZeroBlock Pro will provide unlimited trading and a mobile application that will eventually enable mobile trading, all for a monthly subscription of $20 per month.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry iPhone users, the application itself might have a chance in the App Store, because Apple currently has a host of Bitcoin trading platforms within the app store. Time will tell if Apple and its notorious stance on Bitcoin apps will have an effect on the eventual mobile trading platform. Eventually, ZeroBlock may become the first mobile Bitcoin trading platform, which could drastically increase the continued adoption of virtual currencies.</p>
<p>The partnership between the three companies aims to provide users with a holistic and professional approach to Bitcoin, including trading, price data and news. According to Cary, &ldquo;by merging a world class trading platform with the most popular mobile Bitcoin app, Blockchain will lead the way for institutional investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additional features of ZeroBlock were not made in the announcement, but there is speculation of support of additional exchanges and exciting trading features. This is exciting news for the Bitcoin ecosystem and has the possibility of establishing ZeroBlock as a trusted trading platform.</p>
<p><em>Will the acquisition propel the growth of Bitcoin?</em></p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm trying to write a Mining client for Scrypt-based mining using Stratum Communication.
As of now, I have some trouble verifying all my bit orders and sequences. Hashes I'm generating get always rejected due to not meeting the Target.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is a full sequence of data, starting from the information I get from the stratum server (coinbases, merkles,...) to a final hash.</p>

<p>I could already verify parts of the algorithm (mainly from input to a valid merkle-root, using the information of <a href="http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stratum-mining/" rel="nofollow">http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stratum-mining/</a> , and a scrypt hashing, using the block header from <a href="https://litecoin.info/Scrypt" rel="nofollow">https://litecoin.info/Scrypt</a> ), but I guess there is some endian problem in between, or something completely different, I don't know... With a full workflow I could verify where the error happens.</p>

<p>Does anyone know where to get such data, or how to generate them for myself?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The blockchain is a database of all valid transactions, but is there a company/project that also logs all transactions which were broadcasted, but didn't made it to the chain? Blockchain.info for example, keeps a history of all double-spends, so I assume they keep such a log, but its not publicly available.</p>

<p>I could very easily calculate how much was lost by transaction maleability if something like that was publicly available.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Stuck duplicate transaction in BitcoinQT]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/22663/stuck-duplicate-transaction-in-bitcoinqt]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I received two payments with the following transaction:</p>

<p><a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/12e487de6fd8d920446cd8663dc11977d185ceaa25b7c6f36921fb76e58875f0" rel="nofollow">https://blockchain.info/tx/12e487de6fd8d920446cd8663dc11977d185ceaa25b7c6f36921fb76e58875f0</a></p>

<p>On this transaction</p>

<p>1HT1vrdy2fegnVKaTE1rqsFzfPVDpiWYjf output receives 0.1341765 BTC and 19tj6SNnJqZqmDvMuhrjwPudX8qVcT392a output receives 0.27240743.</p>

<p>I have this transaction in my BitcoinQT client. It shows confirmed and everything is fine. The problem is that I have another transaction which has the same inputs and outputs with the above but a different TxID.</p>

<p>It has been stuck in my wallet unconfirmed for two weeks. BC.info does not show this transaction. Neither does any other online service. Below are the full details.</p>

<p>I have around 10 other transaction in my wallet like this. What is this?&#65532; Why is this happening?</p>

<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/22623/new-altcoin-tries-to-connect-to-other-ip-addresses]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I took the litecoin code and changed all instances of litecoin, Litecoin and LTC.  I also commented out the DNSSeeds in net.cpp.  I haven't made any changes to coin amount or blocks yet, just want to see if it works first.  When I start it up after making a .conf file it does this:</p>

<pre><code>2014-02-24 05:26:14 Added 600 addresses from 127.0.0.1: 0 tried, 600 new

2014-02-24 05:26:14 trying connection 50.7.99.187:9705 lastseen=276.3hrs

2014-02-24 05:26:14 connect() failed after select(): Connection refused

2014-02-24 05:26:14 trying connection 94.226.121.199:9705 lastseen=184.1hrs

2014-02-24 05:26:19 connection timeout
</code></pre>

<p>It keeps trying to connect to tons of other IPs, I assume it's trying to sync the blockchain but there shouldn't be one on a new coin.  I"m guessing there is some litecoin code still in there somewhere that I need to change.  My conf file:</p>

<pre><code>rpcuser=newcoinrpc
rpcpassword=thecodeitspitsoutwhenrun
rpcport=3001
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=192.168.1.*
rpcallowip=0.0.0.0
server=1
daemon=1
gen=0
</code></pre>

<p>It even says this before it starts to connect to those addresses:</p>

<pre><code>2014-02-24 19:05:17 init message: Loading addresses...
2014-02-24 19:05:17 Loaded 0 addresses from peers.dat  0ms

<link><![CDATA[http://www.rugatu.com/questions/25879/bitmonet-without-bitpay]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to experiment with bitmonet, however you need to have a bitpay account to use it. As far as I know it is open source, so maybe the code can be amended or forked to add Coinbase support (or maybe another easy to access API)?</p>
<p>The award is for you if you have a working easy-to-use website where I can configure this, just as current bitmonet (only a github repository is okay if instructions are easy to use). Proof of this will be a working implementation on my side. Of course the implementation should be just as open source.</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[https://pay.reddit.com/r/bitmessage/comments/1y49lk/modified_linux_compilation_instructions_for/]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>Not sure where to post this and creating a login on the wiki fails so I can't propose the change there.</p> <p>The instructions for Fedora and RedHat (and their variants) has the user create a static, permanent LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. After fighting with this for a week on Fedora 20 and even going so far as to burn 2 days trying to rebuild a "non-hobbled" RPM, I finally tracked down the problem (it just wasn't using the variable) and the solution.</p> <p>Instead of setting s global/permanent variable, use a wrapper script and set the variable in a slightly different manner. The following will actually work:</p> <p>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/openssl-compat-bitcoin/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" /home/&lt;yourusername&gt;/PyBitmessage/src/bitmessagemain.py &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</p> <p>Using the above code to set the variable...it actually uses the preferred/correct library. The second part (for anyone non-Linuxy) starts the process in the background and then dumps all output (STDERR and STDOUT) to /dev/null so you don't have a continual "waterfall" of output should you start the client from a shell prompt.</p> <p>If anyone would be willing to propose the change on the wiki/site, I'm SURE it would help others.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/DarkLight72"> DarkLight72 </a> <br><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitmessage/comments/1y49lk/modified_linux_compilation_instructions_for/">[link]</a> <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/bitmessage/comments/1y49lk/modified_linux_compilation_instructions_for/">[2 comments]</a>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[What do you think about placing other people's questions on other websites?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://www.rugatu.com/questions/25823/what-do-you-think-about-placing-other-peoples-questions-on-other-websites]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>You can comment from three points of view:</p>
<p>A) The questioner in Rugatu.</p>
<p>B) The person placing the question on another website, obtains the answer, give the answer on Rugatu and gets the reward.</p>
<p>C) The person who answered the question on another website.</p>
<p>My opinion is:</p>
<p>From A: If I put a question, to me seems right that someone else put it in many websites as possible, get the answer and get the reward. (I have the benefit of getting the answer).</p>
<p>From B: I'm working to obtain the response, I deserve credit (and reward)</p>
<p>From C: I give the answer without expecting anything in return, but it would be nice to be informed about what happened in Rugatu.</p>
<p>Overview of the topic: It seems appropriate put other people's question in all possible webs, get the answer, put it in Rugatu, earn the reward; then inform the person who answered in the other website about the issue in Rugatu. (Optionally: invite him to enter Rugatu and tip him).</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>(I am asking for an opinion, there are no right answers, there are no wrong answers.
There is no reward. Please do not add reward to this question).</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<pre>Track and report wallet transaction clones

Adds a "walletconflicts" array to transaction info; if
a wallet transaction is mutated, the alternate transaction id
or ids are reported there (usually the array will be empty).

Metadata from the original transaction is copied to the mutant,
so the transaction time and "from" account of the mutant are
reported correctly.</pre>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<pre>Handle "conflicted" transactions properly

Extend CMerkleTx::GetDepthInMainChain with the concept of
a "conflicted" transaction-- a transaction generated by the wallet
that is not in the main chain or in the mempool, and, therefore,
will likely never be confirmed.

GetDepthInMainChain() now returns -1 for conflicted transactions
(0 for unconfirmed-but-in-the-mempool, and &gt;1 for confirmed).

This makes getbalance, getbalance '*', and listunspent all agree when there are
mutated transactions in the wallet.

Before:
 listunspent: one 49BTC output
 getbalance: 96 BTC (change counted twice)
 getbalance '*': 46 BTC (spends counted twice)

After: all agree, 49 BTC available to spend.</pre>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div><p>I am working on a project based on bitmessage where I'll be externalizing totally the keys (or die trying...) The idea is to create an address, pass it to the user in the form of an encrypted token, delete it from the server's keys.dat and restore it when the user comes back (providing he comes back before the 2.5 days limit). </p> <p>This would establish a (more) "trustless relationship" between the user and the server. The user doesn't have to trust the security of the server, he doesn't have to trust the admin to be honest, etc... The server would simply not have your keys (as it should be anyway...it is your key)</p> <p>It should be quite easy to implement. I added a method to the python API to be able to call shared.reloadMyAddressHashes() on demand but it doesn't work. I get the debug message saying 'reloading keys from keys.dat file' but it seems the keys.dat is not reloaded. </p> <p>Here is how I test and fail :</p> <ol><li>I cut the last address block of keys.dat and paste it in a file</li> <li>run the daemon, loads the keys</li> <li>Try to send a message using the address I just deleted =&gt; fails</li> <li>Restore the address block in keys.dat</li> <li>Call reloadMyAddressHashes via the API</li> <li>Try to send a message using the address I just deleted =&gt; fails again</li> </ol><p>I am obviously missing something...

But specifically what would need to happen for Digital gold to start replacing what we physically hold valuable. As technology progresses we are putting more value in things that are digital.

<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/21811/solo-mining-gen-1-needed-when-using-minerd]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm guessing maxcoind follows the same conventions as bitcoind. I've read up most everything except the actual source code but it seems that's the only place to find my answer!</p>

<p>Anyways, so when I go ./maxcoind getmininginfo - I get hasheshpersec = a fraction of what's pumped into it by ./minerd.</p>

<p>When I go ./maxcoind setgenerate false, hasheshpersec drops to 0... while minerd still happily spits out a huge KH/s rating per thread. </p>

<p>My question is thus: Does the wallet daemon (maxcoind/bitcoind) need generation to be set to on in order to mine solo with minerd?</p>

<p>And why doesn't those hashes show up in hashespersec?</p>

<p>As I understand gen=1 makes bitcoind/maxcoind mine... and that makes sense, seeing as that the hashrate reported is basically equivalent to the hashrate per thread I get from minerd. So if that is so, where do I see the total hashrate fed in by minerd?</p>

<p>And also, can I push multiple minerd instances on many PC's into the same wallet daemon? </p>

<p>Thanks so much for explaining all this!</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/21770/how-to-interact-with-bitcoind-using-c]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I know that bitcoind is written in C++, but I cannot figure out how to use its API within my program. I have been using a Python wrapper effectively, but I need another process running that is as quick as possible. Is there a library somewhere for bitcoind? Thanks.</p>

<p>Or could you just point me to a good Json-rpc library?</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://www.rugatu.com/questions/25612/can-bitcoin-save-our-economy]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Well my question is written on the title as you can see.
Can it? It is not real money you can spend on anything as soon as you can even lay your hand in one but to my suprise it is way safer than using banks,credit cards,cash, (etc) I have thought of something very humorous like a newspaper titled (Bitcoin to stop terriost funding) lol that would be funny, imagine a currency as a superhero? Very childish I know but yes that is my question. </p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/21608/can-long-time-taken-for-confirmations-become-blocker-for-bitcoin-adopotion]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>As of today, it is observed that up to 6 confirmations are needed in most of the places to verify that the transaction is complete. Assuming that it takes 10 mins for one confirmation, it takes up to 1 hour for 6 confirmation. This is really long time. People want real time transactions and would be reluctant to wait for such a long time. Can it become blocker for bitcoin adoption?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Where to find P2pool networks.py settings for altcoins?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/21442/where-to-find-p2pool-networks-py-settings-for-altcoins]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Is there a forum post or website where all the altcoin networks.py settings are being shared? I can see the P2pool forks on Github where people commit their own networks.py settings back to their own repository but none are being merged back into the original forrestv/p2pool repository. For now, I am specifically searching for the Digibyte altcoin but would like to add the other altcoins later on as well.</p>

<p>I am talking about this part:</p>

<pre><code>    litecoin=math.Object(
    PARENT=networks.nets['litecoin'],
    SHARE_PERIOD=15, # seconds
    CHAIN_LENGTH=24*60*60//10, # shares
    REAL_CHAIN_LENGTH=24*60*60//10, # shares
    TARGET_LOOKBEHIND=200, # shares
    SPREAD=3, # blocks
    IDENTIFIER='e037d5b8c6923410'.decode('hex'),
    PREFIX='7208c1a53ef629b0'.decode('hex'),
    P2P_PORT=9 338,
    MIN_TARGET=0,
    MAX_TARGET=2**256//2**20 - 1,
    PERSIST=True,
    WORKER_PORT=9327,
    BOOTSTRAP_ADDRS='...'.split(' '),
    ANNOUNCE_CHANNEL='#p2pool-ltc',
    VERSION_CHECK=lambda v: True,
    VERSION_WARNING=lambda v: 'Upgrade Litecoin to &gt;=0.8.5.1!' if v &lt; 80501 else None,
),
</code></pre>

<p>And if none are being shared publicly, how do I edit the settings myself for the different altcoins? </p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Bitcoin without mining]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/21057/bitcoin-without-mining]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Several months ago I've stumbled an interesting question about the Ripple system: <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/7550/how-does-ripple-solve-the-double-spend-problem">How does Ripple solve the double-spend problem?</a></p>

<p>Specifically about how double-spending is solved in Ripple. As you can see only @David Schwartz replied to my comments and only he was able to give an answer, given that I think he works for Ripple.</p>

<p>But if he's right, this would be revolutionary in a way, since Bitcoin electricity wasting mining could be replaced by this system.</p>

<p>In any case, my question is: can Bitcoin mining be replaced by a Ripple sort of system? How would that work?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Are there any games that are gold farming friendly? Gold farming is where you collect ingame currency and sell it for real money, or Bitcoins. It's a criminal offence to do this on games like Runescape and World of Warcraft due to the fact that they legally own everything. So I'm looking for games that permits you to do real world trading.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Possibly 80's, from USA. A group of coworkers arrive by plane to a tropical island to receive a leadership course. Immediately upon arrival asked to sign a life insurance policy to start the course. A person refuses to sign, instructors indicate that if one person does not sign, then the course will not be performed. Nobody reads the insurance and all signed. The chief instructor informs them that what they just signed is a complete surrender of all their human rights and thereafter can do whatever they want with them. Nightmare Begins (psychological and physical torture) and the attempt to be rid of it.</p>]]></description>

<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/19951/cgminer-not-working-with-amd-app-sdk-2-8]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Before I install AMD APP SDK 2.8, I get this error from cgminer 3.7.2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[2014-01-06 22:44:56] Error -1001: clGetPlatformsIDs failed (no OpenCL SDK installed?)

</blockquote>

<p>After I install APP SDK 2.8, I get this window:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cgminer.exe has stopped working</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My graphics card is ATI Radeon HD 545v. I have tried both Catalyst 13.4 and 12.10. The software versions are all 64 bit (except miners).</p>

<p>After installing SDK 2.8, guiminer exits when I run it. Before installation it shows a window:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No OpenCL devices were found.<br>
  If you only want to mine using CPU or CUDA, you can ignore this message.<br>
  If you want to mine on ATI graphics cards, you may need to install the ATI Stream SDK, or your GPU may not support OpenCL.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Cannot get BITCOIND RPC connection working on Ubuntu 12.04 or Windows 7]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18369/cannot-get-bitcoind-rpc-connection-working-on-ubuntu-12-04-or-windows-7]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>OK, I recently posted trying to get help connecting to BITCOIND using Ubuntu or Windows 7.</p>

<p>In Ubuntu (Virtual Machine under Win7 64bit) 12.04 Desktop LTS I have the following written in my BITCOIN.CONF file located in $HOME/.bitcoin :</p>

<pre><code>server=1
rpcuser=hello1
rpcpassword=12345
rpcallowip=*
</code></pre>

<p>I run BITCOIND with following command:</p>

<pre><code>./bitcoind --server --rpcuser=hello1 --rpcpassword=12345
</code></pre>

<p>But when I try and connect with the Ruby script (see <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=85495.msg3773215#msg3773215" rel="nofollow">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=85495.msg3773215#msg3773215</a> ) it gives an error saying it can't connect.</p>

<p>Likewise, under Windows 7 I attempt the same procedure and using NIRSOFT cports app I see Bitcoin daemon is only opened under port 8333, not 833*<em>2</em>* as one would expect if RPC connection was active.</p>

<p>I've opened TCP/UDP port 8332-8333 in port forwarding of router.</p>

<p>What on Earth am I doing wrong here? 
<strong>Why can't I connect to Bitcoin daemon via RPC?</strong> </p>

<p>==&gt; <strong>BONUS QUESTION:</strong> I'm quite new to Ubuntu; how do you check open TCP ports at terminal in Ubuntu? (equivalent of netstat in windows)</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Wrong fee on transaction]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/14484/wrong-fee-on-transaction]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have sent a (&gt;10000 byte) transaction to mtgox, blockinfo reports that the network fee is lower than recommended, so it will take quite a long while to get confirmed.</p>

<p>I was thinking I can send another transaction with more attractive fees - but that represents two difficulties:</p>

<ol><li>I don't know why the client didn't calculate the correct fee</li>
<li>mtgox uses a single address per transaction, and so I won't get a new one until the current one completes.  If I send another transaction to the current address, when the slow one finally gets there, it will go to the wrong address.</li>
</ol><p>I am not sure what is the best way forward.  I am using bitcoind v80500.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can get a transaction into mtgox without breaking the one I have currently waiting for confirmation, and if so, how can I get the fees to be right?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I've recently created a Subreddit on Rugatu. You can go check it out. I'm hoping that users would use the Rugatu subreddit. This could also potentially increase Rugatu traffic, which I hope would happen.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>1.When did you earn your first bitcent ? ( 10 mbtc ) </p>
<p>2.How ?</p>
<p>3.If you have not earned one , how do you plan to ?</p>
<p>4.What is your next goal in bitcoins ?</p>
<p>I will give rewards of 0.5 to 2 mbtc to posts , if they are good.</p>
<p>If you have not yet got a bitcent , <a href="http://freebitco.in/">this website</a> can help you ( fastest average dispense of any faucet ) </p>
<p>I would also recommend <a href="https://coinchat.org/">coinchat</a> ( It is currently down )</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Maximum number of block erupters raspberry pi can handle?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/14131/maximum-number-of-block-erupters-raspberry-pi-can-handle]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm trying to figure out where the bottle neck in terms of bandwidth would be.</p>

<p>Assume:</p>

<ul><li>no other processes running on raspberry pi (700MHz processor, no
overclocking)</li>
<li>no limit on internet up/down rates no limit on power of
external USB hub (5V, 12A power supply)</li>
</ul><p>What is the maximum data rate that the usb bus can handle?
What is the maximum data rate a block erupter could ever need (I don't know how to convert Hashes/s to Bytes/s on the USB bus)</p>

<p>Are there tools I can use to grab these numbers (e.g. some utility like netcat?)</p>

<p>Can I put a 10-port usb hub in each of the two raspberry pi usb ports?</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Will expensive mining equipement have any worth in the future?]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/13670/will-expensive-mining-equipement-have-any-worth-in-the-future]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>With more and more people picking up advanced ASIC miners, the difficulty is going up while the remaining coins are going down. If miners continue joining at this or a faster rate, the limit might be reached much sooner than originally expected. </p>

<p>I worry about purchasing any mining equipment because I don't want to have a $2,000 investment that can not recoup its cost within say, 10 years - or at all.</p>

<p><em>So is it even worth buying newer mining equipment, or is it better to stick with whatever is around?</em></p>

<p><code>UPDATE:</code> To clarify, I'm not asking about how an ASIC mining rig can be reused. I am well aware that it has a single purpose and cannot be reused. I'm asking if it is even worth spending a lot of money on such a thing.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[&quot;Failed to subscribe&quot; - poclbm over SSL - Ubuntu]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/13201/failed-to-subscribe-poclbm-over-ssl-ubuntu]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>So I have setup <code>bitcoind -daemon</code> on a server. On plain HTTP, I can connect to the server from my machine and start mining with <code>poclbm.py</code> (at a slow rate but I am preparing my environment before upgrading H/W)</p>

<p>Then I have created the self-signed certificate successfully, and from a remote machine I can get the SSL certificate validation using <code>openssl s_client</code> command. I had trouble with the <code>openssl s_client</code> command when not including the</p>

<pre><code>rpcsslciphers=TLSv1+HIGH:!SSLv2:!aNULL:!eNULL:!AH:!3DES:@STRENGTH
</code></pre>

<p>part in the conf, but after adding it it as ok.</p>

<p>Then added option <code>rpcssl=1</code> in bitcoin.conf.</p>

<p>Now I get a <code>Failure to subscribe</code> followed by <code>IO errors - 1, tolerance 2</code>.</p>

<p>Is there anything else to check? Running <code>poclbm</code> with <code>-verbose</code> doesn't show more output.</p>]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Open Transactions Client (for Grandmas)]]></title>
<link><![CDATA[http://www.rugatu.com/questions/3691/open-transactions-client-for-grandmas]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Asked by Obsi on <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=105506">bitcointalk</a></strong></p>
<p>I'm not even going to pretend to understand all the features &amp; possibilities that Open Transactions offers. </p>
<p>I read a bit about it and felt like I should take the short bus from now on. Baskets here, nyms there, Chaumian something or other... it frankly left my head swimming and I put it on my list of things to look into when I had more free time (and possibly a brain upgrade) to try and wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>But that doesn't stop me from realizing that OT is very powerful and can become extremely useful in the future.</p>
<p>So to claim this bounty we need you to provide an easy to use, open source, cross-platform client. Something my grandma (who thinks firefox is "the google", and "internets" her emails to me) would be able to use.</p>
<p>FellowTraveler has stated that the API is high-level &amp; easy to use, so anyone making a client really only needs to worry about the display layer. He recommends using C++ or Java since those are the best tested.</p>
<p>I simply haven't dug into OT enough to adequately make such judgements, so I will defer to FellowTraveler in this regard. If he says you have created such a client I will make good on my portion of the bounty.</p>
<p>Devs and testers are available in #opentransactions on FreeNode</p>
<p>You can read more about OT here: <a href="https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki">https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki</a></p>
<h2>BOUNTIES</h2>
<p>Obsi     -  100 BTC<br>
FellowTraveler   -  80 BTC<br>
da2ce7   -  some BTC<br>
Donations    -  5.2505 BTC<br></p>
<p>To further fund this bounty send bitcoins to :  166siuo8xaJQLKJRZTk9DFPympSA9CUWt4<br>
(Changed original address to a show a permanent one generated for this request by Rugatu)</p>]]></description>

<p>I would like have hotspot based on some popular WiFi router, like Linksys or Ubiquiti.
Person pay with BTC and get access to internet.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Better if hotspot will be self sufficient. Some hardware, like Dlink DIR-320 has USB port. It can be used for USB flashdrive as storage of blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better if it will have options, like counting traffic or time, several bandwidth throttling degrees, depending on price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better if hotspot will have 2 SSIDs - one private and one public.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7998.msg964093#msg964093">Stephen Gornick</a></p>
<p>The ability to share a router for use by the operator for internal use as well as offering access commercially.</p>
<p>Software License: [flexible, GPL or BSD]<br>
Hardware supported: [incomplete]  (probably WRT54G, etc., also Ubiquity Nanostation2)<br>
Payment methods: Both Bitcoin or Voucher Code (i.e., a code for a 2 hour pass, 1 day pass, etc.)<br>
Private access: Second SSID for internal use, WPA2 protection<br>
LAN /ethernet: Full access<br>
WLAN DHCP: Supported (optional)<br>
WLAN Static IP: Supported (optional)<br>
Remote admin: Supported (optional)<br></p>

<p>I would add a requirement to support roaming so that devices like wifi-enabled cell phones could use a network of these whitout touching the standardc cell network. I would prefer if the rande of each access point was greater than 100m, but I think FCC limitations on the ISM bands that wifi uses will get in the way.</p>
