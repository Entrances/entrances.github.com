"Ho ho, winter time is here
So enjoy the soup dear

I've got some bitcoin in my ear
But please don't fear

My friend is Mickey Mouse
Yesterday I visited his house

Goofey was there too
We watched the cows say moo

And then the lightning strikes
Makes everything clear
We all yelled yikes
And the Bitcoin came out of my ear

In the lightning Goofey found some pearls and rice
That's kinda nice
But the oyster says he wants them back
He just got stuck and lost his track
We made the dude our pal
Actually his name is Hal

Now we all hang out in the mall
See you later and give us a call"
