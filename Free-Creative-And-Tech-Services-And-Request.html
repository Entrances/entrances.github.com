Hello Crypsi, <br><br>

So, I have been thinking a bit about the joke. It's been in the back of my mind. Something about a monkey and a barn. Let's see...<br><br>

A monkey walks into a barn. Hello, he says, because monkeys can speak in this fable. Hrm... Actually it's not a monkey but an ape. But let's call him a monkey for convenience. Hello guys. Anyone here?<br><br>

Hello, says the octopus. How's it going dude? Yes, I'm fine thanks, says the monkey. How are you? I'm ok. Having many arms is sometimes useful in the barn. But where are all the cows? The monkey asks. Octopus: Cows? Uh no, this is a cowless bar.<br><br> 

The rat shows up from behind the hay. Hi guys, rat says. How's it going? Pretty well, the monkey says.  Hi Charlie, octopus says.<br><br> 

Suddenly, hooga hooga. It's the ghost.<br><br>

Hi ghost, octopus says, how's it going? Practicing your terrifying growl? Yes, ghost says. Hope I didn't interupt you. No, we're ok, octopus says. How about you, monkey, were you terrified? Monkey: No, just a little bit surprised. But it's ok. I haven't been here before so I am trying to learn a bit about your customs.<br><br>

The sun shines in through the window. It is a happy day in the barn. Octopus: Can you tell us some interesting mystery, Mr. Ghost? Ghost: Oh, yes, I know about many mysteries. Did you know about the Flying Dutchman? The guys: No. Ghost:well, there was this flying Dutchman. Actually, just a normal dude sitting on a flight from Brussels to Moscow. But, for us ghosts, normal stuff and especially technology is kinda mysterious.<br><br>

Hey, rat says, I have some flapjacks, wanna share? Guys: Yeah.<br><br>

You know, monkey says. I don't play whackamole. I pity the mole. Ghost: Yes, that's right. It's a disturbing game. Let's be nice.<br><br>
