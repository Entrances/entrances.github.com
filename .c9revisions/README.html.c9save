This is a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtRwmRxDS7rhdEFhY1IzUXJqVjVwTzkxYkJEaTBwdGc#gid=17\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"welcomeMsg\">list of our current holdings</a>.   That means whenever one of the assets we are currently holding becomes   liquid on a XRP, BTC, LTC or other established cryptomarket we can sell   them there and you can profit because you are entitled to a share   according to the following formula: 95% of the gains goes to a   cryptocash pile which will be redistributed to the GIT holders and 5%   goes to the OpenData distributed entity for continuing the efforts,   paying rent, electricity etc. To receive your share simple send the GIT   back to the account you received them from originally and we will send   the corresponding amount in XRP, BTC (IOU) or LTC (IOU) to you.<br />\n          <br />\n          Each GIT entitles you to [cash pile value] / (divided by) [total number of GITS which on the 19th of March 2013 is 70000].<br />\n          <br />\n          E.   g. On October 5th 2013 you want to exchange some GITS for cryptocash.   You have 5 GITS. We currently have 1300000 XRP in the cash pile.   Therefore each GIT is worth 1300000/70000=18.57 XRP. So 5 GITS would   give you 92.86 XRP. This is just an example of course and the value of   the XRP might fluctuate a lot over the course of time but just to show   you how the model works.<br />\n          <br />\n          <strong>How to acquire <a href=\"https://github.com/Entrances/GIT/wiki/GIT\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"welcomeMsg\">GIT</a>:</strong><br />\n          <br />\n          - We currently have a <strong>giveaway </strong>going,   anyone who trusts the account below with 100 GIT or so will receive   0.01 GIT as a reward (in our opinion the current value of the GIT should   be about 5 BTC or 30000 XRP).<br />\n          - Work and submit pull requests to our <a href=\"https://github.com/Entrances?tab=repositories\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"welcomeMsg\">GitHub.com projects</a>.
